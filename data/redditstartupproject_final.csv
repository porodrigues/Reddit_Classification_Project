jfobqb,I might be in a pickle with regards to physical addresses. Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

jfn6ld,"Do you have the ""founder procrastination syndrome”?",0,1,startups,"Before becoming a business owner or startup founder, was your background in management? Did you have a leadership job before starting your business?  


If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfmvco,Managing burnout as a startup founder,0,1,startups,"Hey startup founders,

How do you **handle burnout** these days?

This happens to a lot of ppl I know (me included), especially since ""hustle culture"" is pretty prevalent these days.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

Anyways, I'm hosting a 'Founder Conversations' event where I'll share some of my favorite tips of how to manage burnout and we'll also go into break-out rooms where you can connect with other founders and discuss further.

My Zoom account limits me to 100 event attendees so this event is 1st come, 1st serve!

Hope to see some of you there, especially if you are facing burnout/stress/anxiety lately (or have tips to share!)

----

Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn't have a job for almost 2 months. My daily routine was to get up, open several job posting sites and look through all of the jobs that I thought were a good fit for me. I did this for almost 2 weeks and I just couldn't  continue doing this as it was a huge drain of my time. I spent nearly 5-7 hours a day on reading about the employers, tweaking my resume and sending it to them. 

That's when I thought of Jobleter. I didn't want for people to waste all that time while searching for a job. Jobleter is a weekly newsletter (currently for developers only, but will be expanded) that contains hand-picked new jobs from verified employers. 
Hope you like the idea.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong?

jf0f1b,Start up question -- what to do next?,0,1,startups,"Hi everyone, I appreciate any feedback or insight you can provide here. I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

* I was using Stripe, but requires me to code something into my application, which I don't understand at all. I just want to embed a payment form on a WordPress website.

Options I'm considering:


* PayPal. Meh, I haven't had a good experience with them.
* Gumroad. Seems intriguing and they have subscription options. This is my top choice for now.
* Any other suggestions?

jfd3ef,I'm running a data science company and I need some help. (Please?),1,1,startups,"I started my data science service business out of college 1.5 years ago and I've been trying so hard.

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

I'm currently making courses on Udemy on the side to earn some income however it is very hard to keep data scientists around with that little earning.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

jfmvco,Managing burnout as a startup founder,0,1,startups,"Hey startup founders,

How do you **handle burnout** these days?

This happens to a lot of ppl I know (me included), especially since ""hustle culture"" is pretty prevalent these days.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

Anyways, I'm hosting a 'Founder Conversations' event where I'll share some of my favorite tips of how to manage burnout and we'll also go into break-out rooms where you can connect with other founders and discuss further.

My Zoom account limits me to 100 event attendees so this event is 1st come, 1st serve!

Hope to see some of you there, especially if you are facing burnout/stress/anxiety lately (or have tips to share!)

----

Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn't have a job for almost 2 months. My daily routine was to get up, open several job posting sites and look through all of the jobs that I thought were a good fit for me. I did this for almost 2 weeks and I just couldn't  continue doing this as it was a huge drain of my time. I spent nearly 5-7 hours a day on reading about the employers, tweaking my resume and sending it to them. 

That's when I thought of Jobleter. I didn't want for people to waste all that time while searching for a job. Jobleter is a weekly newsletter (currently for developers only, but will be expanded) that contains hand-picked new jobs from verified employers. 
Hope you like the idea.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging.

With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

Would love to hear your different opinions!

Kind regards,",1603301616

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

I'm currently making courses on Udemy on the side to earn some income however it is very hard to keep data scientists around with that little earning.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

jfobqb,I might be in a pickle with regards to physical addresses. Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

How do you **handle burnout** these days?

This happens to a lot of ppl I know (me included), especially since ""hustle culture"" is pretty prevalent these days.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

Anyways, I'm hosting a 'Founder Conversations' event where I'll share some of my favorite tips of how to manage burnout and we'll also go into break-out rooms where you can connect with other founders and discuss further.

My Zoom account limits me to 100 event attendees so this event is 1st come, 1st serve!

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’

jfa19x,How to / Where to best keep logs for your SaaS that can be queried easily and cheaply for analytics and for tech support?,32,1,startups,"Hi all!

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

Cheers!",1603274635

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

jf0h3t,Startup question -- what to do next?,1,1,startups,"Hi everyone, I appreciate any feedback or insight you can provide here. I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)? I am racking my brain trying to determine the best path forward and I would like to make a decision by the end of this week. Thank you again for any insight you can provide here",1603233702

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging.

With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

* Selling monthly subscriptions to a paid community on Slack

What I want to do

* Just embed a payment form and/or link to a payment page.

Why I'm lost

* I was using Stripe, but requires me to code something into my application, which I don't understand at all. I just want to embed a payment form on a WordPress website.

Options I'm considering:


* PayPal. Meh, I haven't had a good experience with them.
* Gumroad. Seems intriguing and they have subscription options. This is my top choice for now.
* Any other suggestions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

I'm currently making courses on Udemy on the side to earn some income however it is very hard to keep data scientists around with that little earning.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

jfn6ld,"Do you have the ""founder procrastination syndrome”?",0,1,startups,"Before becoming a business owner or startup founder, was your background in management? Did you have a leadership job before starting your business?  


If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.  


If you want to learn how to get things done when you are spread thin and feel you’re not productive enough [**click here to watch my brand new video!**](https://aristoteldascal.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&amp;notrack=1&amp;s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&amp;i=87A106A6A422)

**Here’s what I’m going to cover in the video:**

How do you **handle burnout** these days?

This happens to a lot of ppl I know (me included), especially since ""hustle culture"" is pretty prevalent these days.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

Anyways, I'm hosting a 'Founder Conversations' event where I'll share some of my favorite tips of how to manage burnout and we'll also go into break-out rooms where you can connect with other founders and discuss further.

My Zoom account limits me to 100 event attendees so this event is 1st come, 1st serve!

Hope to see some of you there, especially if you are facing burnout/stress/anxiety lately (or have tips to share!)

Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn't have a job for almost 2 months.

I spent nearly 5-7 hours a day on reading about the employers, tweaking my resume and sending it to them.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging.

With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site.

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

Would love to hear your different opinions!

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

jfa19x,How to / Where to best keep logs for your SaaS that can be queried easily and cheaply for analytics and for tech support?,32,1,startups,"Hi all!

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward.

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jflv2t,I created a free weekly job newsletter for developers - I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.,0,1,startups,"I developed and launched a free weekly newsletter (**[Jobleter](http://jobleter.com/)**) featuring **hand-picked** new jobs from **verified** employers. It's only for developer at the moment, but will be expanded. I'm also developing a resume builder that will also be free for all users and will be available by the end of next month.

----

Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn't have a job for almost 2 months. My daily routine was to get up, open several job posting sites and look through all of the jobs that I thought were a good fit for me. I did this for almost 2 weeks and I just couldn't  continue doing this as it was a huge drain of my time. I spent nearly 5-7 hours a day on reading about the employers, tweaking my resume and sending it to them. 

That's when I thought of Jobleter. I didn't want for people to waste all that time while searching for a job. Jobleter is a weekly newsletter (currently for developers only, but will be expanded) that contains hand-picked new jobs from verified employers. 
Hope you like the idea.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

jfhhoy,Big companies with trash websites,11,1,startups,"Hello everyone!

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’
•What should be the priorities to be well prepared for any future workplace disruptions?

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

I've turned down potential investments because I wanted to figure things out but now cash is really tight. I'm 23 and I have an appetite for risk but it gets hard to see my small team of 3 people struggle day in and out.

I'm currently making courses on Udemy on the side to earn some income however it is very hard to keep data scientists around with that little earning.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I dive deep into one of these options? Do you have a better suggestion? Should I go about a combination (part time employee and one of the other solutions)?

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

If you did, you may have felt the “founder procrastination syndrome”.  


Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

How do you **handle burnout** these days?

This happens to a lot of ppl I know (me included), especially since ""hustle culture"" is pretty prevalent these days.

But the long term success of our companies/projects often depends on how healthy we are internally/mentally...

Anyways, I'm hosting a 'Founder Conversations' event where I'll share some of my favorite tips of how to manage burnout and we'll also go into break-out rooms where you can connect with other founders and discuss further.

My Zoom account limits me to 100 event attendees so this event is 1st come, 1st serve!

Hope to see some of you there, especially if you are facing burnout/stress/anxiety lately (or have tips to share!)

Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn't have a job for almost 2 months. My daily routine was to get up, open several job posting sites and look through all of the jobs that I thought were a good fit for me. I did this for almost 2 weeks and I just couldn't  continue doing this as it was a huge drain of my time. I spent nearly 5-7 hours a day on reading about the employers, tweaking my resume and sending it to them. 

That's when I thought of Jobleter. I didn't want for people to waste all that time while searching for a job. Jobleter is a weekly newsletter (currently for developers only, but will be expanded) that contains hand-picked new jobs from verified employers.

jfjmc6,Understanding the Passion Economy with Li Jin [micro-startup-founder advice],1,1,startups,"**TLDR** \- There are tons of different ways to define the Passion Economy, but I love what Li says about it: H*ow do we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.*

Li was recently on a popular business podcast talking about all things the Passion Economy, how it differs from the creator economy, rebuilding the middle class, and communities and brands.

I felt like I was watching a lecture on Passion Economy 101. I took some notes if you're interested:

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

jf8ct1,This is how I launched 6 failed side-projects in 10 months,6,1,startups,"After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong? One more cost effective resource I have found to test this out is this company [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/). What are your thoughts?

For #2: Only costs $1800 for the year long membership but is very dependent on whether or not we can recruit good sales agents in the platform. I think it is possible but may take time

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline 

&amp;#x200B;

Help?,0,1,startups,"As a result of a recent move, I decided to basically virtualize everything about our business – including going, after much research, with Earth Class Mail for our address. Well, turns out it wasn’t enough research: all of my contacts who use them have been doing so for years and never ran into any of the CMRA issues I am now.

It began with our bank: they would not except my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses Dun and Bradstreet. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail. I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

Let me explain...  


You probably have a team of developers building your software product, and they are probably using Agile Scrum as a methodology for their day to day planning and execution.  


They meet regularly, plan the week, the day and just get stuff done.  


But who are you meeting with to plan your work with, and keep each other accountable? You have so many responsibilities and things to take care of...  


From big picture to small operations tasks, you have to get them all done. And here, right here, in these “work modes”, is both the reason for an overwhelming procrastination as well as the opportunity for amazing success.

1/ Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.” (FYI Li coined the Passion Economy)

2/ “It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li

3/ Many people get this confused, but the Creator Economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.

4/ “The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.” — Li

5/ New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:

* Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)
* Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)

6/ “It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li

7/ Li defines community as: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest in one another.”

8/ Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: *What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?*",1603307988

jfikat,Feeling like a small business owner so depressed,5,1,startups,"I started working on a circular economy startup idea about a year ago. The idea was to sell plastic-free goods online with an unlimited take-back program in reusable packaging. Due to unforeseen logistical issues, the reusable packaging option fell apart, and now I just have single-use cardboard boxes, just like all the other gazillion e-commerce store out there.  With that, the circular economy aspect of it also fell through so now I am just like another mom and pop shop but with an e-commerce store.

I don't have anything against small businesses, it just I didn't want to be a one. But now I feel like I am a one and am incredibly depressed. I am in an MBA program, and people ask me what my startup idea is on a daily basis. All I can say is it's just an e-commerce site. I can see the underwhelming emotions in their faces right after I answer. 

Is it normal to feel like this? How can I get out of this and be motivated again? I guess I am just depressed and ranting. Thank you.",1603304834

For the past 4 years I've been studying graphic/motion design, and I've done 3 internships for 2 different companies. I'm in my graduation year and I want to start my own company somewhere in this field and see a lot of possibilities.

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to continue?

jffl47,"Woocommerce with Web Dev Agency vs Shopify, which one should I use for building an eCommerce website?",1,1,startups,"Posted a few days about this, just require some clarity and advice

Some context: I am building an online e-commerce store for modern children's toys. The website will have more than 200+ products. I am not trying to build just an eCommerce website, each product will also have an in-depth review and overview of the product. Features and Functionality the website will have:

Online Marketplace, Rental option, In-depth review and overview of each product, reservation and booking functionality, one-click checkout, real-time shipping rates, standard as well as dropshipping, and other customisable functionalities.

My question is can I make a website as good as or even better than what Shopify provides?

I know I have to hire a good web agency which I am in the process of hiring. But can woocommerce deliver with the help of good plugins and their integration with the help of a web developer? Be bug-free, have good speed and performance, responsiveness and integration of functionality and plugins? Can this be achieved with the help of a web agency, managed hosting, CDN, good server management system, etc

Also which would be more cost-effective in the long run with all the maintenance and plugins? I know Shopify is also not cheap with the basic 30$ monthly fee + monthly plugins fee. There are also some other issues that I have with Shopify such customizability, scaling, the fact that one does not fully own the store, and double transaction fee charged by Shopify on every sale.

Would love your input on this. Also, can someone suggest good premium themes and templates for woocommerce?",1603295876

With the strains on today’s global market, combined with the restrictions on movement and corporate spending, there is no doubt that the workplace of tomorrow is changing. As a result, the way we work is also changing. Indeed, even the way we think about work, how it takes place and where we work is evolving too.

While there’s no ‘one size fits all’ or fool proof strategy that works for every business in such uncertain times. One thing certain across the global workforce is the need for more business resilience: to adopt more flexible working strategies to give their businesses a better chance to adapt to crisis as and when they arise.

A few ways Flexible Workspaces can improve business resilience:
•More agility to adapt business practices
•More options to scale up and down according to headcount or space required
•More mobility for teams that commute, travel for work
•Less capital expenditure and inventory needed to manage

Key Discussion Points
•The Future landscape of the workspace environment
•The key learning about a real estate strategy which involves ‘flexible space’

I got some clients through referrals but growth has been stagnant over the past 6 months. I'm based out of Nepal and no company over here is looking for data science solutions since they are not in a scale where data science is needed and the pandemic has really restricted everyone's budget.

I've tried to build connections with companies in America/Europe but even a simple message saying 'Hi!' sounds like a sales pitch coming from this side of the world. I've been hustling on LinkedIn, reading and practicing what book on sales say, talking with a lot of businesses, etc. but I've had no luck.

As a fairly new startup with only a handful of clients on our SaaS platform, we want to make sure our method of logging for tech support and business insights is good before we scale. We have some basic logging going for our application to AWS Cloudwatch; however it's already becoming difficult to conceptualise how we're going to run analytics on these logs as they build to give us up-to-date, actionable data to find frequent issues, trends, peak times, etc. 

We'd obviously love to have this data be real-time, but it seems too costly, so maybe running these as cron jobs is better? But it still feels odd and not very scalable.

We could be putting this data into a SQL DB and query that, but does log data belong in a database and is it scalable?

We're now questioning if logging to cloudwatch is the right move. 

I'd love to hear how some of you handle this kind of thing.

First (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider, nomadmail.io. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

I launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.

After spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.

2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.

After that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.

**So I create**

nomadnest.org and alternative to Couchsurfing, 2,162 visits, I made more money from it than from nomadmail. And I did it in one weekend.

coffeelist.co: a coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.

nomadasdigitales.com, a digital nomads community in Spanish.

lanzame.net, a Product Hunt in Spanish.

classline.io, a SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for nomadmail.

**What I learned**

* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.
* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.
* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.

That's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. To think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.

But I keep thinking and thinking and making. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.

I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong?

For #3: No real concerns about this unless we brought someone on a salary. I think with the state of our pipeline, it would be unwise to add that much overhead to the business without a fat pipeline

jf0f1b,Start up question -- what to do next?,0,1,startups,"Hi everyone, I appreciate any feedback or insight you can provide here. I am running a professional services firm (sales outsourcing and consulting), we just started 3-4 months ago and we have brought on all of our current clients exclusively via outbound prospecting. We have gotten to a point where I do not have the time to prospect anymore and bring in business for myself because I am too busy running the business and fulfilling services for our clients. This is going to be problematic if it continues for too much longer because our pipeline will dry up! We have a 5-6k budget to use next month in an attempt to solve this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see if, I have a couple ways I could go about solving the problem:

1. Begin investing in paid to assist with TOFU production
2. We have been looking at a platform called commission crowd as another method of helping with TOFU (they charge $1800 for a year and 1% of closed won business)
3. Hire an employee to fulfill services to clients (part time or full time, if full time we would likely pay a 50-60k salary to this individual)

Are there any other suggestions?

If no, my biggest question is around, what do you think is the best way/order to go about deploying my budget to free up my time?

For #1: I am concerned that we do not have a large enough budget for it to be realistic for us to begin investing in paid -- we charge anywhere from $7,800-$15,500/ mo on a retainer for full stack outsourcing and consulting and I feel like if I do not have at least 3-6 mo of runway to spend on paid, it may be too risky of an investment, but maybe I am wrong?

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

I feel like I spend weeks in analysis paralysis trying to just get to the point of even deciding to spend minimal effort on an MVP. Seems like there's lots of resources out there on how to validate a single idea, but very few on how to pare down the list, and I just don't have time to validate all of them fully...

I saw in [r/entrepreneurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurs/), someone posted a link to [https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/](https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/) which had some templates which seemed kind of interesting. Anyone have thoughts on this, or a better process they've found?

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning. After having these experiences and watching The Social Dilemma on Netflix, we decided to develop TopStoriez.

Website: topstoriez.com

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

ja8z0i,I am selling a Free Hosting Reseller with Real Clients,13,1,Startup_Ideas," 

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j8s8ih,Process for prioritizing which ideas to spend time validating/testing,0,1,Startup_Ideas,"Hi all!

I've been struggling with getting hung up on ""too many ideas"", and am having trouble deciding where to prioritize my efforts. I feel like I spend weeks in analysis paralysis trying to just get to the point of even deciding to spend minimal effort on an MVP. Seems like there's lots of resources out there on how to validate a single idea, but very few on how to pare down the list, and I just don't have time to validate all of them fully...

I saw in [r/entrepreneurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurs/), someone posted a link to [https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/](https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/) which had some templates which seemed kind of interesting. Anyone have thoughts on this, or a better process they've found?

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left.

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

jaeryk,How to turn your skills into an online business idea,1,1,Startup_Ideas,"Hi everyone - 

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details.

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Thank you for your time. We're waiting for your feedback :)",1603229227

jeofco,Problems to brainstorm ideas to solve it,15,1,Startup_Ideas,"Recently, I started in this world of looking for ideas to start my own startup, and after having some of it, I have found that they have no social interest, of it has been already developed.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

**So, my idea is to post here problems that we see around and have a brainstorm on how to solve it.**",1603196667

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

j7baci,"For years now, I’ve wanted to build a remote startup company with focus on helping others to achieve their professional goals with services such as: Resume Writing, Interview Preparation, Career Coaching, Career Development, Leadership Coaching. Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

It's basically a stock photographing app for Instagram stories(photo, boomerang, video).

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning. After having these experiences and watching The Social Dilemma on Netflix, we decided to develop TopStoriez.

Website: topstoriez.com

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

I saw in [r/entrepreneurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurs/), someone posted a link to [https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/](https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/) which had some templates which seemed kind of interesting. Anyone have thoughts on this, or a better process they've found?

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share.

A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

ja8z0i,I am selling a Free Hosting Reseller with Real Clients,13,1,Startup_Ideas," 

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left.

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

jaeryk,How to turn your skills into an online business idea,1,1,Startup_Ideas,"Hi everyone - 

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this.

My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details.

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Thank you for your time. We're waiting for your feedback :)",1603229227

jeofco,Problems to brainstorm ideas to solve it,15,1,Startup_Ideas,"Recently, I started in this world of looking for ideas to start my own startup, and after having some of it, I have found that they have no social interest, of it has been already developed.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

**So, my idea is to post here problems that we see around and have a brainstorm on how to solve it.**",1603196667

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

jaeryk,How to turn your skills into an online business idea,1,1,Startup_Ideas,"Hi everyone - 

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

j7baci,"For years now, I’ve wanted to build a remote startup company with focus on helping others to achieve their professional goals with services such as: Resume Writing, Interview Preparation, Career Coaching, Career Development, Leadership Coaching. Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

It's basically a stock photographing app for Instagram stories(photo, boomerang, video).

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share. I saw news from the US and Russia that people are paying for getting photoshoot in a private jet, not flying just photoshoot. A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning. After having these experiences and watching The Social Dilemma on Netflix, we decided to develop TopStoriez.

Website: topstoriez.com

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

I saw in [r/entrepreneurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurs/), someone posted a link to [https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/](https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/) which had some templates which seemed kind of interesting. Anyone have thoughts on this, or a better process they've found?

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195

Even I had friends who are asking if I have any boomerang or photo of a sports car or at a party or the new Jordan shoe, so they can share.

A lot of Influencers looking for minimalist stories of oat milk so they can share in the morning.

In TopStoriez, people can sell and buy Instagram stories. When people want to share fake stories, they're checking Pinterest. But it's not good in many ways. People can find that you're sharing fake stories easily, copyright issues, wrong photo format(or no boomerang) and it doesn't look like you took the photo because the photo looks too professional. When searching stories on Topstoriez, you can choose many features like the phone model, the location and you can search by tags. It also allows people to earn money by selling stories who are not professional photographers.

Then, I talked with a friend that has some successful startups in Denmark, and he told me that the best way to start, is to find common problems that many people have, and be creative in trying to solve it.

As an example, in Denmark, some guys thought that it was a problem all the food leftover in the restaurants, so, they developed an app where the restaurants post the food that they believe is not going to be sold and put it in in discount, in that way, customers, can see big discounts in food, and restaurants can sell what is about to be left. ( I don't know if that was an original idea, or not, but I liked the story)

What are our thoughts on dating app that replaces SMS with FaceTime?

I think it is perfect for the current times we are living in even afterward because people are use to being on zoom calls for work/classes

I find that there tends to be a limit to the impact of words on Bumble/Tinder and its peers. Face to face video interaction, I speculate, may assist both parties in their efforts to gain greater knowledge about their perspective ""friend.""

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things:

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)
2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

ja8z0i,I am selling a Free Hosting Reseller with Real Clients,13,1,Startup_Ideas," 

Hey, guys!

In the end summer '19 I started a web hosting reseller website - [http://www.websitefreehost.com](http://www.websitefreehost.com/) . As it is one project too much for me, I decided to sell it.

There are a few things you ought to know about the business:

Once you acquire the project, you won't have any responsibilities, except paying for the domain name to your provider of choice, and to market your new business, of course.

If you have a well-developed website, especially somehow related to digital marketing, creating websites, technology, or anything other, in fact, you could easily utilize the traffic that you already have.

As of today, Website Free Host has exactly **100 clients**, and without advertisement or any marketing at all, 1353 people have landed on the site.

The website has an Instagram and a Facebook page. With 1818 followers and 248 likes, respectively.

The price, that I am looking for is $2.5 a client. Meaning $250 total. The price is discussable within reasonable confinement.",1602575506

I've been struggling with getting hung up on ""too many ideas"", and am having trouble deciding where to prioritize my efforts. I feel like I spend weeks in analysis paralysis trying to just get to the point of even deciding to spend minimal effort on an MVP. Seems like there's lots of resources out there on how to validate a single idea, but very few on how to pare down the list, and I just don't have time to validate all of them fully...

I saw in [r/entrepreneurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurs/), someone posted a link to [https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/](https://idea2mvp.carrd.co/) which had some templates which seemed kind of interesting. Anyone have thoughts on this, or a better process they've found?

j80ovb,Looking for a way to make money in market trends? Check out this idea,2,1,Startup_Ideas,"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this. Here it is: Is it legal to capture someone's email from a form before they click submit? Is it ethical? My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases. These users have filled out the form, but not submitted, so right now we are not collecting their contact details. I know it's technically possible to collect the emails from the email field before user clicks submit - **but should I?**",1602175537

Now seems like a better time than ever.",9,1,Startup_Ideas,"This will be something that I start off on a part-time basis. Now that I’m permanently working remotely for my regular full-time job, I feel that I have the time to dedicate to building this business plan and taking some steps forward. 

This business idea is basically all that I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

Anyone have any advice on starting a remote startup? Phased approach vs. going all in? Anyone have any recommendations for building a website?",1602156195
