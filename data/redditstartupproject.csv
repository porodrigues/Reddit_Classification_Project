Paying 3rd party creators.,1,jeg3p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jeg3p2/paying_3rd_party_creators/,0,1603187655.0,I’m creating an e-commerce site (most likely with WordPress) where 3rd party creator content will be for sale.

Leveraging old technology owned by someone else for a new use,1,jef9o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jef9o4/leveraging_old_technology_owned_by_someone_else/,2,1603184633.0,"Hi community friends - I have a question and I am hoping you all can give me some helpful advice. I have an idea for a start up that would leverage another companies technology for a brand new use and I am wondering how I can set up an arrangement that doesn’t end in me being cut out once everything is up and running. 

As an example, imagine I had the idea of using AI to predict the quality of avocados - i do not own an avocado farm or an AI company but (imagine) this could be a profitable arrangement for both parties.

How do I approach an AI company without them just taking my avocado idea and leaving me in the dust? What do i need to set up to make sure that doesn’t happen?

"Fun app idea for startup: should I do Android native app, or Web app?",1,jecyih,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jecyih/fun_app_idea_for_startup_should_i_do_android/,12,1603176896.0,"Hey guys looking for some getting started advice. I'll describe the general requirements, my skillset, and resources available. 

App outline: using the front facing camera showing the user next to a video playing next to it (so I'd split the screen in half), the app helps the user record and learn dance moves. So imagine you set up your phone on a table facing you and record yourself following a dance routine. 

Technical requirements: obviously I need access to the phone's front camera, and I need to load and play videos, probably from a web server. 

Goal: create a fully functional MVP. There won't be too many features, I want to start small and put something on the app store (or where ever). 

Skills and resources available: I have intermediate experience with Android native development and website development. I'm not even considering iOS at first because a) I've never done it, b) I just need one mobile platform to test my idea. 
Also in terms of resources I can probably (and likely will) hire an upworker or related online contractor to quickly throw together the most time consuming parts / ""shell"" of the software. 

So really on the technical side I'm wondering between the choice of:

A) native android app that interacts lightly with a web server (for video files and stuff) 

B) a website to be loaded on the phone, but I think I'd still wrap it in an app, so e.g. the app would open the site in an iframe or however that works (and thats all the app would do)

What do you guys recommend? I'm looking to balance ease of getting started with the potential to keep working on the product without later rewriting everything for a separate platform. 

Feedback appreciated, thanks!",1

So due to the COVID crisis, myself and an acquaintance found ourselves out of work. Seeing that finding employment at this time will be almost impossible and that we have sporting backgrounds (football administration and sports marketing), we decided to open a sports promotion and consultancy agency but getting clientele has been diffiult probably due to a lack of brand recognition and largely a monopolization of the market but we figure we might be onto something with our services (if of course given the chance to shine).

To try drum up some interest, we are thinking of releasing a ditigal magazine covering local/regional sports along with a special audiobook documenting the history ofdifferent sporting codes within our country.

Do you guys think it is a viable strategy that can translate to interest sports fans? Even if we become successful on this front, there is the possibility that it could flame up or blow up and while wee aren't necessarily interested in being content creators, we are fearful of the setback it could cause. If by the chance we get successful, how do we then convert the interest of sports fans into something attractive for sporting organizations to consider working with us? While we have no clientele, should we focus on the content creation or should we entertain the idea of doing events free of charge to get the word out? Should we reach hope to professional sporting organizations to work for them on a free basis to get some rep?

Anyone who disagrees, I would ask them if the followers-count/sales-converted is even a half percent.

Not trying to rant, just wish that I had seen the post I have written months ago. I feel it's a waste of time.

A good way to witness this is to watch writers support each other...no one is remotely concerned about buying a book, they just want to ""support"" another writer's book to get them to do the same, and...nothing ever gets done.

They get a commission for each user they get us through their unique link.  
They also get a bonus when they have reached x amount of users (a low number)  
They get a bonus when the first post about us is published.

Combining Time and Milestone vesting for a CTO - What are some good milestones for a CTO to have to trigger extra equity?,4,je7jz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/je7jz7/combining_time_and_milestone_vesting_for_a_cto/,2,1603161277.0,"He would be more of a CTO/Co founder hence the slightly larger than usual %.

\- He gets 10%, 1 year cliff with 4 year vesting period

AND

\- He gets another 5% (which adds the the equity being vested in that remaining year of the above) if the ARR is at a certain level by the end of year 3.

AND/OR

\- He gets another another small % if we manage to secure a certain amount of investment within the 4 year time vesting period.  But he would need to have made a significant contribution to us being able to get that investment (I don't understand how this would work though if it's more of subjective thing that I decide).

Because of this, I’m hesitant to buy bulk, but looking at their costs, it can be up to $30/1000 pulls from their API which might add up quickly depending on the response the app gets when we go live.

I have been open officially for about a month, but I am still running at extreme loss.  I have spent about 1k marketing alone via Facebook ads, but have also spent close to 2k on construction in the store, and another 1k or so on systems and computers within the store itself.

I dissolved partnership with my co-founder.

He's a non teche guy.

I did not find it much intresting because there's already big players in that domain. Instead I had something else in mind. I wanted to digitize local shops and want to build an eco system for small and medium business. I pitched the idea to him. He liked it very much and asked me to be the CEO of this business because I envisioned it.

So we finished the paper work. Since the beginning, I didn't feel like he's adding any value to the company. Because, I'm the one engineering the solution, doing ui/ux designing the product, taking care of branding, positioning the product, crafting a narrative for the market, setting the direction for the company.

I gave him few tasks but he couldn't meet my expectations. 3/10. So I'd to redo the tasks for myself. All of our meetings go for 3 to 5 hours continuously and I feel so drained by the end of the meeting because I feel like I'm interacting with a manager. Lot of talk but no substantial contribution to the solution.

So today I dissolved the partnership with him. Luckily we both haven't made any big investment into the company yet. When I told him my reasons to dissolve the partnership, instead of being understanding, he went defensive mode and started attacking me saying he doubt my leadership abilities, that I'm not business centric and don't know resource management, lacks emotional stability etc.

It's ironic. I'm the one who's doing the heavy lifting. He comes up with obvious things and presents as grandiose things which I don't find valuable.

He wants to go on and build the same solution. I don't have any problem with it. But my only concern is, I don't want him to use the solution spec and the user flows that I've drafted. Because I've designed them with great emphasis on user experience that the solution is SO SIMPLE to use.

I want to preserve that user experience and flow for myself because I made it.

Should I tell him not to use what I've made and come up with other user flow for his solution? Or should I let go of it? 

This is his 3rd time trying to build a business. His first two business were into consulting which he made when he was 19. But both of them were not successful. Now he's 26. He's still new to the startup world and lacks business maturity.

I'm also 26. I've my own startup since 5 years and worked with several investors, advisors. He's got so much of exposure working with me. But he doesn't get that. The comments he made got under my skin and into my head. I tried to sort the personal comments he made but of no help. In return he questioned me, what I've done so far and has the nerve to say that he has contributed so much to the solution. I'm feeling like errrr.. he's scratched my ego.

More Common VC/Investing Terms,106,jd3rw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jd3rw5/more_common_vcinvesting_terms/,19,1602999657.0,"Since you guys enjoyed the last time we created a common list of VC/Investing terms here is another one:

More Common VC/Investing Terms

1. **Soft capital commitment:** it’s when an investor says that he/she will invest money once some milestone is hit (generally that milestone is getting the lead investor). No papers are signed at this point and those commitments are very fragile. When the COVID hit most of such commitments disappeared in an instance.
2. **Lead investor:** The first investor in a funding round; can be also referred to as the anchor investor. Those are hard to find and sometimes anchor investors get better terms for additional risk they are taking. 
3. **Down Round:** A fundraising round in which a company raises money at a lower value than before. For example, if you raise your series A at 10 million valuation and then raise Series B at 8 million valuation - that’s a down round. Horrible thing to happen with a startup and sometimes kills the company completely.
4. **Anti-dilution Clause:** A contractual clause that protects investors from having their investment value reduced in future funding rounds. This clause protects investors from the down rounds - if she invested 2mil at 10mil valuation and a startup had to raise additional capital at 8mil, she will be given additional shares.
5. **Pro Rata Rights:** A contractual clause that protects investors from having their stake in the company diluted. This means that investors are allowed to buy additional shares at every round of funding to maintain their stake in the company. So an early investor in Uber might maintain her 1% in the company even on the day of the IPO because of that provision (she’ll spend some extra money retaining this stake of course).
6. **Bridge round/bridge loan:** A round of funding or a loan that helps a company achieve a certain milestone that it couldn’t achieve using money from the previous round. For example the founders have $100k in their account after their Seed round but they want to acquire additional 10k users prior to raising their Series A. That will cost additional $300k and at this point bridge rounds/loans are coming into play. Generally bridge rounds/loans are raised from existing investors.
7. **Cap Table:** paper that provides data on who owns what percentage of the company, when did they join and at which value did they invest. One of the must-haves at every single round of fundraising.
8. **Management Fee:** The fees that General partners of Venture funds charge their limited partners each year. VCs pay for their due diligence and sometimes provide support to the startup (such as accounting services, legal services etc.) by taking money from that management fee. If you work with a small fund, chances are they won’t be able to help you with that since their management fees are small.
9. **No shop clause:** A clause in a term sheet that prohibits founders from sharing the term sheet with other investors in an attempt to receive a competing offer. Rarely used in real life, but if an investor wants to sign one of those with you, run a very precise background check on the investor - that might be a sneaky move by a sketchy VC.
10. **Party Round:** A round in which a startup raises multiple investments from a lot of small investors. This is becoming a new trend because “it’s easier to raise 10k from 10 investors than 100k from one investor” - that statement isn’t always true so you have to assess the situation yourself. We recommend party rounds for founders with large networks of industry professionals who are making $100k+/year in salaries.
11. **Washout Round:** A round in which founders and previous investors get significantly diluted. The new investor in this round will most likely gain majority ownership. Basically it’s like a bad version of the acquisition. Washout Rounds (similar to washout sale) happen in the situation of the company crisis - this is the last resort for a startup. 
12. **Lock-up Period:** A specific amount of time that must pass before someone can sell their shares in a startup. That’s one of the downsides of IPOs - founders of the company frequently face 6-18 months lock-up periods and that’s why some companies (like Spotify) prefer direct listing. These provisions also prevent investors in your company from running around selling your shares the next day they bought them.

What tools have you used for two-way engagement (“chatbot-like”) with customers over SMS?,2,jcmi5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jcmi5t/what_tools_have_you_used_for_twoway_engagement/,20,1602927214.0,"I am looking at a business idea that will include direct customer engagement through SMS around health related habits. I am not looking for marketing blasts, but preferably for a sort of SMS “chatbot”.

I would like to start engagements at user-defined times in the day (as defined through java webforms), say 7am and 7pm to check in on healthy habits, and engage with them to ensure they have completed a task.

So I should be able to text John at 7:30am to check in with him and ask if he has completed activity X. He might text back: “not yet, will do in a few, can you remind me in 10 min?”. Then the bot will schedule a follow up based on the indicated or preferred time/delay. Once the task has been completed, John should either be able to respond to a reminder, or just text back (on his own terms/time) that the task has been completed. 

The initial MVP would need to serve 20-50 individuals, all with their time-based preferences for completing the task, and their own preferences for the intensity of follow ups, while being able to track (free text if possible) different responses that can indicate: 1) completion, 2) delay but intent to complete without further desire for follow up, and 3) delay with request to follow up.

PS: And does anyone know if these platform can randomize the “time of outreach” (within a preset and/or escalating time range) and randomize the “message” from a set of, say, 5-10 different versions of the same message?

We’re looking to grow and have been debating about bringing a person to help run the overall business (basically be a CEO). We’ve been approached by one product tech guy. He’s looking for 10% equity in the company. Is this reasonable?

Reason for bring this person in is because none of the founding members have any experience in raising capital or scaling a company. We know that there’s a lot of potential in this growing field, but we’re just not sure what the next step is.

- We’re all being paid by Company A, but all working 100% on Company B, a new company the founders have started. I wasn’t even made aware this was an entirely different company—I was initially told that Company B was just the name of our new product. Company B is an entirely separate entity legally and has no employees. It’s been in place for well over 7 months now.

- Company A had significant investment put in by a variety of investors. None of them know that Company A is essentially just being drained out so that my sketchy and neurotic boss can fund his new project ie Company B.

- They had me write/contribute to two important documents for Company B: an investor memo, which is essentially a sales pitch to get investors to invest, and a government funding application. On the first, I was told the product was ready, so investors were led to believe it’s completely ready. On the second, my boss edited my work by saying that the product was in the R&D phase. I confronted him about this yesterday, asking which it was, and he said “neither”; that the product is well advanced, just not fully out to market. When I asked if I could send corrections for the two documents he said no—that both documents are “just marketing materials that you’re supposed to adapt to your audience”. While that’s true to an extent, product readiness is a substantial item that needs to be presented accurately.

- In this same conversation, he went on to say that governments are dumb and you just say what they want to hear. This has me thinking that he’s probably been dishonest in other parts of the business, and probably done so with Company A too.

What do I do here? This is not okay. Investors from Company A need to know what’s going on with their money. Potential investors in Company B deserve to know how the business and product are doing honestly in order for them to make a well-educated investment. The government is being lied to.

- How should I go about reporting this? I’m in Ontario, Canada. 

- I contributed to these documents thinking I was writing accurately, going with the information given to me as a new employee. How do I protect myself?

* This happened right before the pandemic and our industry was affected so layoffs have happened across the board and we're operating pretty lean right now. 
* Software integrations are being worked on and underway, also I'm not working on the tech side of things so I can't speak too much to that yet. 
* Each company's product(s) is fairly complex with a medium to very difficult learning curve.

Do you have any suggestions on how to approach organizations or people with the idea that we want to save them the time wasted on their performance review process but also introduce a background feedback system which is automated?

Thanks, looking forward to your thoughts!

I am wondering what makes more sense:

I have a small corporation with a cofounder, and we are not paying ourselves a salary.

We are however expensing personal living expenses (rent, internet, food) to the company

Is this a better route for tax purposes, or paying myself a small salary so I can cover those things with my salary.

Working for free - advice? Any and all input is appreciated.,2,jcb8po,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jcb8po/working_for_free_advice_any_and_all_input_is/,4,1602888867.0,"Hello,

I'm a working student \[ I study business and finance, this is where my interest lies as well \]and I've worked in a range of roles dealing with business functions and operations along with some general    administrative work.

Just to give you a fair idea:

I've dealt with business functions and tasks such as managing operations, logistics coordination, product sourcing, inter-departmental coordination, data and business analysis, preparing business reports and feasibility reports on new ideas, tracking project updates and other key metrics, etc.

I've also dealt with general administrative work or carrying out the functions of an assistant. Everything from schedule management, managing internal and external correspondence, coordinating various activities, organizing remote meetings, business/technical writing, client invoicing and billing, tracking and managing budgetary spending on various projects, etc.

Due to certain reasons, I'm only open to working remotely.

This is not a troll post or anything. But, I'm genuinely looking to work for free - to be more specific - looking for a mentor or to work as an intern. Any advice on how to proceed? 

Ideally, I'd want to work under an experienced business/startup owner. So that, I'd get the most out of this experience.

I know that offering to work for free sounds sketchy and unreliable due to the lack of accountability involved. Any tips on how to avoid this?

And, before anyone brings this up. I'm well aware that the best way to learn is to actually work in that niche/field. I totally agree with that. But, with the pandemic and everything, it's been incredibly    difficult for me to land any roles. I feel like I'm really wasting away all my time. So, I thought this would be a good way to make use of it by gaining more experience and increasing my network as well.

It’s been a long time I and other core members have been feeling that she is just bossing people around and not sticking to the business model. I personally felt that she joined in at first because she thought she could use me to make her dream come true and it has been confirmed today as she talked to one of our advisors like that. 

I genuinely feel happy and as I finally can take things off my chest, but still want to keep a nice friendship with her.

However, choose your co-founder carefully, no matter how excellent they are. Make sure everyone is on the same page.

So with that in mind, which CMS/Website builder should I use, and what hosting should I use for both woocommerce and Magento?

The benefits of using our platform are: 1st month commission free, cheaper delivery than other services, better customer support (compared to the big players in the field)

Non-technical founder here– 

I have a business that has been picking up decent traction, solid SEO growth, and is making a good amount of sales. I built the proof of concept myself (learned some basics of coding) and with the help of some hired developers. We are growing day by day and I am on the mission to find a tech-cofounder. 

I am wondering if you all might have any tips for a non-technical founder and how to approach developers about a tech-cofounder role? It's obviously a lot to ask someone to hop aboard a company that can only offer sweat equity until a potential investment lands, so I am hoping to see it through the eyes of developers so I can start off on the right foot.

When I test the waters for someone's interest after a bit of light conversation - I usually share my tech-stack, amount of equity I can offer, hours I'd like a tech-cofounder to work, and I do not rush anyone into signing anything. I have had a decent amount of interviews and some candidates that have wanted to move forward, but nothing has really stuck yet. These interviews were mostly found via Founderslist, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc. 

To reiterate - I am just looking to come off in a genuine manner and to not just get lost in the crowd of another solo-founder approaching developers that most likely get messaged about things like this every day.

Any advice is appreciated.

Anatomy of a venture capital pitch,36,jbv1uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jbv1uf/anatomy_of_a_venture_capital_pitch/,18,1602820777.0,"Hi folks, I'm Ankur and an investor from San Francisco.  People frequently ask me about VC pitches and what they are like.  The truth is, every VC is different, but I share my framework that I've used in evaluating hundreds (if not thousands) of pitches and that was loosely cribbed from my own experience having raised over $11m in VC money:

1. Introductions:  Please practice a 90 second elevator pitch about yourself.  Rehearse this until it becomes effortless.  It should hit all of the important pieces of your story that you want to get across but don't need a ton of detail.  Please please don't use up valuable time covering things that don't advance your story.
2. The inspiration:  I like to hear what inspired you to choose the path of entrepreneurship and this specific problem.  I also am hoping to hear why you are uniquely qualified to solve it.
3. Problem:  Your problem statement and why this is a big problem for many people.
4. Solution:  Your unique solution to this problem.  What makes this special in the market and differentiated from the competition.
5. Demo:  Please be prepared to show a demo.  If none available, have mockups or a prototype to walk the investor through.
6. Traction:  If you haven't launched yet, tell me why and what you are doing to solicit customers now.  If you have launched, have your KPIs ready to discuss in detail.
7. Financing:  We'll discuss how much you're raising, how much you have raised, how much you have left, who else is invested, the terms, etc.
8. Next steps:  Either I'll share my feedback right away if I feel strongly one way or the other, or I take it back to my partnership to discuss more.

By and large, raising money is a numbers game.  Most founders have to pitch at least 40-50 investors to get the ball rolling on their rounds.  This is normal!  Keep your head up.",1
Scaling an engineering team,98,jbuz6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jbuz6c/scaling_an_engineering_team/,62,1602820548.0,"I had joined this growing startup as a CTO. I had been introduced to a 60 member engineering team where most of them are developers and doesn’t have any managers. The 60 member teams are split into pods who work on different product vertical. Earlier the 60 member team was managed by ceo itself ( who is a tech guy). But later hired me to handle the team. How do I go about this? I have been observing the team and found the following issues

1. The pods are directly managed by product managers. Engineers are not growing nor have a proper reporting structure. Each Pods include front-end, back-end and qa.

2. Engineering team has a lean structure which results in ownership issues despite having a team lead for reach POD.

Questions

1. There are around 10 pods. Should I hire engineering managers for each of the pods or handling multiple squads and get in a director who would be managing the engineering managers?

2. Does creating too many hierarchies creates communication gaps?

3. Should I hire just engineering managers directly reporting to me without a director or vp? 

I have never managed team of this scale and this is new challenge. Looking out for expert advises :)

UPDATE:

Thank everyone for such a huge response :). I think I got a lot of insights here. Just giving few updates to the question on certain questions asked by few.

One senior ( Backend or Frontend) is the leader of a POD. For eg: If a POD is taking care of Dashboard, a frontend engineer would be the leader of that POD because PODs work is more frontend intensive. There would be backend engg to support but the leader is FE guy. If a POD takes care of transaction processing, BE will be leader. 

There are concepts here similar to spotify chapter which they have implemented. All backend engineers report to a Sr backend engineer ( who was a very initial team member, but I feel he has a hands on developer for 4 years, limited experience ). All frontend reports to a Sr FE dev ( pretty good with exp ). 

The application is moniloth ;). Thats another big challenge. The startup had grown so fast that they were on a run to build and ship. But micro-services is one roadmap to be considered. 


Hierarchy is as follows

POD1.....N -> POD Leaders -> CEO ( Now myself )

What I am proposing ( Not sure its gonna work out though )

POD1....N -> 5 POD leaders reporting to an Engineering Manager ( Bad idea ;o ? ) well budget is a constraint as well. Total two engineering managers reporting to me. Later get in a Director to manage EMs and scale EMs as well? And get in a Technical Architect to look at roadmap for splitting monolith to micro to guide the team?",1

Step 1. Identify Brand Heart. Name, logo, pictures, and even videos are material markers. As long as the product does not have a history that ties everything together, these markers are empty.

Step 2. Identify Brand Messaging. All these points help greatly to feel the brand, find its features, flaws, ""wrinkles"" and present it to people through design or content.

Step 3. Identify Your Key Customer. For whom everything is planned? Make a detailed portrait of them, because the more specific you describe your person, the easier it will be to understand how to enter their world with your offer.

Step 4. Identify Your Competitors. You need to understand how your competitors work and find your benefits in comparison to them and to highlight them.

Step 5. Design Your Individual Elements. By this time, you have a ton of information to start the identity creation. At this stage, you want to take that text-based information and translate it into visual concepts.

Step 6. Build Your Brand Style Guide. The only thing more heartbreaking than a poorly designed brand identity is a beautifully designed identity that is never used or used incorrectly. A brand style guide is the finish line of this process.

We are just about to launch our website and are trying to get all our ducks in a row.  It is 100% online subscription service for companies to post their prices in our industry.  I imagine nearly 100% will want to pay with credit card.

At the beginning I imagine that subscribers will be relatively low... something like $20 per month with less than 100 subscribers - probably more like 20-50 at the very beginning.  (This is an MVP).  I have reached out to a number or credit card processors and all of them seem to have monthly fees on top of the transaction fees.  With the low volume of transaction and low dollar amount, their take would be just crazy.  Charging $1000 would result in an effective rate of something like 7% - which is crazy!

It seems that everyone who doesn't have monthly fees (and some that do) doesn't want to touch a subscription payment model because they can't get underwriting or risk of chargebacks is higher, etc.

I really don't want to piss away 7% at the beginning because my volumes are low, I would rather pay a higher per transaction fee with no monthly fee.  I don't even need any equipment (I don't think, I have zero experience in credit card transactions and vendors).

Does such a unicorn exist?  Obviously when my volumes get higher, I can rethink the math - but I am very surprised at the lack of options.

All this to say I also understand most startups just flop and the options become useless. I just want to be prepared in the event that I receive offers from any of the companies.

Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any help!",1

Berkeley student looking for advice on taking time off to create a startup.,11,jb9fj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jb9fj6/berkeley_student_looking_for_advice_on_taking/,27,1602737828.0,"Hi all,

I'm a current Berkeley junior studying CS, and I'm considering taking time off from school to create a startup. My idea has been in the works for several years, and because of the online classes/pandemic, I'm considering taking a gap semester to built a prototype. I also have a friend studying CS who is interested in doing this with me. I first thought about this idea two years ago, submitted it to an ideas competition, received positive/negative insightful feedback, and reworked it now.

We are both committed to working hard, learning necessary technologies, and building a finished product. I've been reading a lot of this subreddit, and other stories from founders to see what others have done. I'm looking for advice on this. Within my social circle at Berkeley, I don't particularly know anyone else who has done this or considered this. Mostly, just internship hunting at prestigious companies.

One of my professors indicated to me that pursuing a startup idea is basically all or nothing; it's not worth trying to manage the rigorous courses at Cal with a start-up part time. That's why I'm considering a gap semester as well. My co-founder and I are both competent programmers, and versed in the CS fundamentals. I've been a TA for our data structures course. But neither of us have really any experience with the frameworks, web design, mobile, etc. What are some tools or languages I should be thinking about learning? Lately, I've been looking into progressive web apps for our current design to simplify over cross-platform. Ideally, we'd have a presence on the web and mobile applications, as our idea is initially targeted towards college students.

We are privileged to have capital to support us while we are creating a prototype, and initial money to invest in it if needed.

We've written up pitches, and documents fleshing out our idea - target audience, features, competition, differentiating factors, monetization, addressing which need, etc. If anyone has gone through this process before, and could shed some light on pitfalls or a common path, that would be greatly appreciated. Or a short chat. Thank you all! Go bears

I started doing some market research for my new app idea and my niche did express interest I tested via just a post in a subreddit it got like 7 upvotes and got 4-5 strangers to express interest.

I think that was a good way to feel the water but ideally I want to go a bit further and maybe build a landing page and market it? Mostly to make sure that there is actually enough interest before I create yet another useless app.

I 1) don't know if this is overkill, maybe since I have the dev skills it makes sense to make a super simple MVP and then market that, rather than spending time learning how to market and focusing time there and ultimately probably some money for ads etc.

2) If I was to go the marketing route first what would you suggest would be the best way to go about it, would I create some landing page with like wordpress or squarespace and do some google ads? Is there any resources that go over this process?

TIA!

TL;DR I'm a dev and have talked to my target niche I've identified interest in about 5-10 people from my niche does it make sense to spend more time marketing and gathering interest or build a MVP based on the initial interest. If I should market more is there any resources on how to do this?",1

6 Months of Teams Working From Home: Has Your Business Benefited?,1,jae6v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jae6v5/6_months_of_teams_working_from_home_has_your/,0,1602627074.0,"Our e-Commerce business has been working from home since March 18, 2020. Our team was very nervous at first, not knowing how this new normal of working from home would work out. Turns out it's been **VERY** positive. We're a mighty yet small team of roughly 100 employees with one goal in mind: Help small to medium size businesses grow in size and revenue.

Positive things we've learned while working from home:

* We've excelled in performance and hit KPI's
* We've learned to trust employees to get tasks done in a timely matter. Goals have been met prior to deadlines
* Utilizing Google Hangouts and Slack works really well for collaboration. We don't need an office with a whiteboard in a conference room to sit around and get stuff done.
* Our company has become hyper-focused on data driving us to make better business choices.
* With Q4 here we've ramped up sales and have a very positive outlook for the holidays.

Things we've struggled with while working from home:

* We no longer have social gatherings which really helped build team spirit and positive working relationships. We used to have happy hour once a month with office games and a few social drinks or gatherings outside of the office. Due to Covid, we can no longer do this.
* Because our business has become more profitable, we've been hiring more employees. The downside to this is not getting to meet those new employees in person, or have those fun team building events or social gathering happy hours in person.

Contract Negotiations Help,1,ja2sr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ja2sr2/contract_negotiations_help/,2,1602576908.0,"Hi everyone!

Two people that I have worked with are going to be starting a new company soon. I worked under both of them as a SaaS sales and marketing representative (Many hats, you know how it goes) for almost two years and built up a great reputation with both of them. They personally asked if I would come on with them in a similar role.

Because we will be starting from scratch, I told them I would like to include in my contract a stock option as well as severance pay.

For stock option I've done some research but I'm not sure exactly what to ask for/what is beneficial to me but also reasonable. Something like the option to purchase 1,000 shares for $1 per share at any point. Is this the right direction? Please give me your advice.

For severance, I would like to ask for 6 months of residuals if I am let go (I assume they will respond with stipulations for this). The reason I want to request this is technically if I built up a large amount of residual income, they could let me go any time to save some money (I live in an at-will state). I don't think they would ever do this, but I think it's smart to have some sort of protection from this.

I am the co-founder & CEO of the incorporated Delaware company. I incorporated the company by filing Certificate of Incorporation online and was charged the filing fee. We authorized 10M shares at a minimum par value (0.00001) 

I have been reading the necessary steps almost everywhere but I am still little bit confused. Here why I am confused:

&#x200B;

1) **83(b) Election deadline.** This letter must be sent within 30 days of issuing the shares. What is the exact time of issuance of shares? The moment when the SoS charges my credit card or the moment I file the Certificate of Incorporation? Or the moment when my co-founder & I **make an internal agreement** for the distribution of shares? 

2)  **83(b) Election of how many shares?** We authorized 10M shares. We want to keep 2M shares for the investors & prospective employees. Also, the rest 8M shares will be vested in 4 years with 1 year cliff. In this case, when filing 83(b) Election, should I put 4M or 5M?

3) **Action by Incorporator.** I am the CEO and my co-founder is CTO. Should I just say: Me and my co-founder will be the directors of the company?

This is my first time posting here so I hope this is appropriate!

I have been slowly building a small business locally over the last year. About 6 months ago things started to pick up RAPIDLY. I can now barely keep up with sales alone and am looking into a warehouse and production staff, etc. I have gotten my products into about 40 stores in North and South Carolina (we are based in NC) as the business expands quickly I want to make sure I'm doing everything legally and legitimately!

My business is formed as an LLC in NC. Most of the stores we sell to are small mom and pop shops that pay me cash and retail my products, is this legal? I keep track of all my invoices but I never made any agreements or did any paperwork for these stores. We have our products in 1 large chain that's based in NC but also has stores in SC, this store is very legitimate and gave me all the legal paperwork and tax exemption forms.

We also sell a decent amount of products through our online website but 90% of our sales are wholesale to retail stores and 10% are direct to customers. 

My main questions are:

1. Do I need a special license to sell wholesale products to retail stores as well as direct to customers?
2. Do I need a license to operate in multiple states? I plan to expand to almost every state in the future.
3. Do I need to add sales tax to my wholesale sales?

Ease of use and access is something that drives innovation in all the sectors but being caged up inside homes (for our benefits obviously), I feel the general population is understanding the importance of physical peer-to-peer learning. 

The growth aspects for Ed-Tech sector seem limited and once they hit the caps in terms of revenue, I feel scaling would be very difficult.

I contacted them and asked how much it cost to license their services in my country since they met the need of the market.

Framework/Tools for Startup App Development,1,j99uj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j99uj8/frameworktools_for_startup_app_development/,4,1602467190.0,"Hi,

I'm experimenting with building an app for a startup idea. **I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts/suggestions on which framework/tools to use?** In short, I'm leaning towards [ionic](https://ionic.io/) (I want to be able to deploy across devices). However, given my limited experience with software development, I'm also curious if anyone knows of low/no-code solutions that provide the functionality I'm looking for (see below). OR, perhaps I have no choice but to use a framework such as ionic for this. Please see below for detail on my experience and the app functionality I'm looking for.

**My Experience**:

I work in data science and have good understanding of python and object-oriented programming. I don't have much experience with software/web development, but I don't think it will be too difficult to learn as I go.

**The functionality I'm looking for**:

1. Dynamically render content to a page based on search criteria (will likely have to pull from a database).
2. Provide the ability for users to comment on posts (similar to Facebook, reddit, twitter, etc.)
3. Incorporate a chatbot -- this will likely be built using a 3rd-party software tool, but it will have to be integrated into the app.

Thanks so much for any insights!",1

How we made 8.5k in 3 weeks of launching our agency without a website,13,j92xeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j92xeq/how_we_made_85k_in_3_weeks_of_launching_our/,4,1602439777.0,"**Disclaimer:**  This is not a get rich quick feel-good stories. We are not newbies. We have invested over 20k in courses, books, tools, and more than two years of failure that amounted to “nothing” before a huge step up.

I am grateful for the setbacks and failures because it gave us perspective and knowledge. The tools give us the bandwidth to scale and hop on to new opportunities.

**Highlights:**

* Why we failed for years
* Our Strategy for the launch
* Our next steps to growing the agency

**Why we failed for years**

Before all of these happened, my partner and I were serving the military. For the past two years, we embarked on many dead-end projects. That had us wondering why we were not making as much as we want to.

My partner was an SEO expert. He ran an adult fetish site pulling 30,000k monthly view but could not monetize it. On the other hand, I was somewhat decent at generating business leads and doing sales calls. I ran a b2b lead generation company that could not scale. 

It was not a skill issue.

Things were also pretty rough then, with the army taking up most of our time and mental space. We spent all of our time working on our “side-hustles”, skipping out on parties, gathering, and all the stuff.

I had this constant fear of not succeeding because it only meant two options. I had to either find a job or go back to school once my service ends.

Neither option was appealing to me.

Things continued to be a complete train wreck. The Covid-19 locked down happened nearing to the end of my service. It gave me time to focus and move as we were under stay home orders. 

However, we were not moving in the right direction. It felt as though we were still banging our heads against the wall, this time harder and faster.

Before I knew it, I was out of the army. The direction was still murky, but with every failure and reflection, things started to click. Things were difficult and glim because we did them backward. We were solving problems before they even happen, such as information retention, tracking … etc. You can read my other post [here.](http://mvrck.io/2020/08/22/how-i-improved-my-productivity-by-fixing-my-workflow-and-retention-issues/)

I took the risk and canceled my university admission. I wanted to focus on making this business work.

It dawned on us that we were not out there at all. We were so focused on building the right service or product that we did not put it to test in front of the market. We had the skills, tools, and knowledge to scale but we could not because we have not gotten past step one.

**What is step 1?**

You need two things to make sales.

1. Having an offer that your market wants
2. And getting your market to see your offer

As stupid and generic as it sounds, there are no secrets. If you want to validate your idea, create a landing page with a sales copy and put it in front of your target audience.

**Our Strategy for the launch**

* Find an idea traffic source
* See what the are our competitors were offering, then make it better
* Compete based on price point to get the volume

We found a local listing site where people list their services or items. We researched all our competitors and decided that we could offer a simple web design service. There was not much competition as our competitors were not copywriters and their listing creatives were terrible(Funny how they are designers LOL). 

Next, we created a customer avatar based on the listed services, Reddit threads, local Facebook pages, and so on. This process helps us craft a sales copy that speaks directly to the market.

We built a landing page, put in the copy, and threw in some illustrations from our tool stacks, and we have a minimum viable landing page ready to go.

Branding and positioning matters, as your ideal customers buy based on the impression and general vibes you give them. So you have to stick out like a sore thumb.

Lastly, we priced ourselves just below our competitors. Pretty sure this is counter-intuitive to what most Gurus preaching to charge your worth.

Word of advice is to drop your ego, get the cash in hand, and prove your worth later. Leaving the table with money in your bank account is better than going home empty-handed. Moreover, you never know who this client can refer you too. Relationship building is of the utmost importance when it comes to the agency, so do not burn bridges.

The service was up and live shortly after that. Duplicated our listings a couple of times to maximize exposure and also understand how the platform algorithm works. 

It was around the mid of the second week where we noticed a spike in leads. I was getting incoming calls almost every day.

The leads were all over the place. Most were enquiring about services we do not offer but had the skills and knowledge to fulfill them. 

Out of the 25 total discovery conversations we had, we filtered down to 5 serious candidates. We closed all 5 of them over a 30-45 minutes video conversation with prices ranging from $399 to $6,000.

Having a sales process is extremely important. Most consultants would spend hours talking to clients that would not pay for their service and products. 

I would structure the sales process with a 10-minute discovery conversation at the start. The initial call helps me gauge the prospect’s level of commitment, budget range, and decision-making process. I would then schedule a strategy session. However, if they sound fishy or the deal did not felt right, I would disqualify them. (Always stick to your principles.)

The strategy session is a 20-40 mins video conference where we find out if the prospect is a good fit. During the session, we understanding their pains, agree on the price and handling objections. 

One tip here is to collect a deposit instead of asking for the full price. We would then schedule a kick-off (onboarding) call where we meet them and get into the details and collect the whole sum.

Why? Because this lowers the resistance and prevents a buyer’s remorse. If the prospect is willing to pay you a deposit, they are committed and would pay you the full amount after onboarding. 

The other reason is that you are leaving your cash flow to factors of the unknown.

For example, a client might commit to paying you after the onboarding session seven days away. Something might happen during the week and cancels the engagement. It always happens, so always secure a deposit and remember cash on hand is king.

The onboarding process makes or breaks your relationship with your prospect. I have seen too many gurus talk about closing sales in one phone call and all that BS. Having a great sales process and a shitty onboarding process is like getting catfished on a dating app. It would not do good for your reputation and affects your future businesses.

A well thought out onboarding process instills confidence in your client. One scenario that happened during the kick-off session was that the client was not exactly sure about engaging us because we were young (22-year-olds)in Asian culture. But after the onboarding session, he was extremely impressed with it. He told us that we knew our craft and felt confident in our capabilities that reflected in his firm handshake as compared to before.

During the onboarding process, set the right expectation by understanding your client’s goals, address their concerns, and formulate an action plan of deliverables to achieve the set goals. Do not make promises out of thin air and results, show transparency by helping your client visualize how the actionable deliverables would lead to the outcome they envision.

**What is our next step?**

… And we just rented an office last week.

We are on track to hit the goal to hit 10-15k MRR within the next four months. After that, it would be just scaling, funding other ventures, and ultimately build an agency that can run without us.

Here are our key movers:

Optimize our presence (offline and online) to exist in multiple places to receive opportunities.

Hiring and building an internal team.

Improve our lead generation through strategic partnerships (networking)

Building out internal structure to scale(Financials systems, Work tracking, Goal setting)

I learned from my mistakes and founded a business half a year later iirc.

And this business is going quite well. Their business however failed hard due to Covid 19 as it was an event and promotion business. And my business is doing really well because of Covid 19 as I transformed it into an online business. 

What I founded was an incubator/accelerator. I used to create networking events and seminars where people  would physically come. Covid-19 happened so, I turned it into online seminars.
And because of the lockdowns, I noticed people started to become more interested in online learning. And the audience keeps on growing. We are also partnering up with other figures and organizations and also getting some funding.

I also got a professional looking website and a private email which my previous ""partners"" whom I fell apart with never wanted.

I just want to thank you all for pointing out my mistakes in the previous post.

A lot of people pointed out that I made assumptions and never got them to write things down on paper, and that I gave everything before getting anything from them.

""*This is the part of the story where you become the competitor and run them over.*""
What s/he said stuck with me and it actually came true.

We also got a name for the startup which we are already using on the landing page. We haven't registered our company or anything of this sort, only bought a .com domain. So here are the questions:

1. Am I allowed to use this name and present us as a company?
2. If I am to collect their email addresses using a sign up form on the landing page, are there any GDPR specifies to be considered? Do I already need set up privacy consent, terms & condition or anything of this sort?
3. I have collected a list of publicly available web scraped emails of potential users. Am I allowed to bulk message all of them in order to get them to sign up without ever receiving their consent?

I’m wondering how and when does one decide to pursue a patent.

My reason for not pursuing it is again I have no actual traction as of yet, and even though I’ve done a lot of research I can not determine if it’s a truly new idea (and also I’m almost entirely ignorant of the patent process).

So I guess I’m asking is 1) is pursuing a patent at an early stage even worth it, 2) at what point do you start trying to get a patent and how certain should you be that your work is patentable before you move forward?",1

It was the middle of August in Alabama and I was staying at their house for a few days. I was excited for the project, but when it came time to actually take my saw to the first railing to demolition the old one, I had to stop. I literally sat there for a good five minutes because I realized that if I cut through that piece of wood, I’d have to finish the project. I had to take that leap. I did eventually cut through and someone over the course of three days I rebuilt their deck some twenty feet off the sand.  The conditions were horrible, but I had such pride in the end. 

And ever since then I’ve been so aware of making big decisions. 

Which brings me to my startup. About a year ago I built a site for co-founders to find each other by reading answers to kind of off the wall questions. When I released it to a few people in Colorado, folks really seemed to like it and I got to around 400 users. I didn’t want to charge money though and Azure costs like $70 a month for SSL, so I had to take it down when I got pulled into other work. But now, during Covid I think there’s such a need for a new method of finding people to work with. So I rebuilt my site, and I even now have options to make money from posting jobs or listing your venture.  But now I’m confronted with this intense stage of making a decision. 

I’ve put the site up on a share azure site without pure ssl, but I need to take that leap and actually market it.  I need to sell it because I think it’s cool, but maybe it’s just a time suck and folks legitimately aren’t able to appreciate small startups. I’ve built in pieces like the ability to have virtual “pitch to developer” or “pitch to salespeople” sessions to help folks find each other, and I have so much more planned.

I was wondering the legalities of taking a clip art design, let’s say off of google, and putting it on my own shirts (assuming I read the website, it says I can use it). If not that, can I commission a friend who’s good at drawing to make something for me, I pay him in cash, and leave it at that?

Tech as 3 non-techies,0,j8mund,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j8mund/tech_as_3_nontechies/,13,1602374115.0,"Hi everyone, 2 co-founders and I are planning to start our first company together. Our plan A would be to sell devices that we would import from China and make a compatible app for them. This would be an app for emergencies, and you would use the device for an SOS signal. The idea already exists of course and some companies doing it are pretty successful. The app would work similar to Find my friends or Life360, but it wouldn’t track people all the time, only in emergencies. It would need to have a map, send emergencies from devices, and alert friends and family if you are in danger, so the reliability would have to be high.

Our concern is that we are 3 business students with limited money, little experience and very limited knowledge of tech. Do you think it is an idea that we can pursue if we hire developers or find a 4th co-founder who is a techie? Or is that still not enough? We are concerned that we wouldn't be able to add much to the development of the app, which would be mostly what we are selling. We are getting really contradictory answers. On one hand, we are at a big disadvantage and there is a low chance that we will succeed, but on the other hand, it is quite possible, and not all tech companies have tech co-founders.

What do you think? Should we just completely skip this idea, because we don't have a chance or it will be too expensive? Or do you think it would be possible if we got a techie co-founder?

What I know: I am able to use €1500 capital for advertising, packaging and creating stock. 

I've done the math and I can make 1250 products (excluding vat) for €1200, (including packaging)

 the remaining money will be partially spendt on advertising and/or saved.

This gives me a breakeven of 300 units if all sold online 
Or a breakeven of 380 units if only sold in store

I will have a mix of the two above 


If all are sold I should make a profit of €3500 to €4750




What I don't know:


If I can get VAT back

If it is worth investing in a website

The amount I should spend on advertising

If there's legal problems I may have to deal with

What are the absolute most important things I should be doing while my tech co-founder builds the MVP?,129,j8lljf,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j8lljf/what_are_the_absolute_most_important_things_i/,77,1602369663.0,"I recently had a calll with someone who specialises in validating startup concepts pre-launch, he was super helpful. I specifically asked him what I should make sure I work on while my tech co founder is building the MVP, it will be finished in 1-1.5 months hopefully.

This is what I've done so far to validate the idea (before I had a tech co founder):

* Survey 1200 skincare fans (its a skincare startup)
* Interview 50 of them on the phone for an hour
* Create a waitlist landing page
* Drove traffic to it via Facebook ads (targeting skincare fans)
* Got 250 signups in 2 days, turned the advert off

So I'm aware that this is a good start but no-one has actually exchanged money for this idea, though in theory there is demand. He said that, while my partner is building the MVP, I should conduct a wizard of Oz experiment. While I think this is a good idea, I also think it is probably quite time consuming, and I will also need to be working on getting a group of beta/pilot customers together, since I expect we'll be working on product market fit for a while (if all goes well).

Looking for advice on how to make my business idea more secure and trustworthy,1,j8k0cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j8k0cf/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_make_my_business/,3,1602363415.0,"Hello guys,  
My startup is about game rentals. This is more or less the idea: I have a site/app where people sign-up and place their games, that they are willing to rent out, on it. The renter pays a bit of cash to be able to rent out the game for a month or so. I get a portion of the money (like 20%) and the rest goes to the loaner and all 3 parties are happy. 

Now, the question that I get a lot is: How can you make sure that the renter gives the game back? or Can't I just loan out a game that is defect and when the renter then claims that the game is not working, I could blame it on him so that he would have to pay me back the worth of my game? I got asked about these and several other scenarios of fraud. 

My initial idea was to make people that sign-up to register with their visa card so that if someone didn't return a game I could claim the value of the stolen game or that as long as a game is rented out I would 'freeze' a certain amount of money on the visa card until the game is returned. But neither one of those options would protect the renter from fraud, from the loaner lying about the condition of the game and blaming it on the renter. Other solutions where for example that if you put a game for rent you have to first send me a video that shows how the game is working properly but this can easily be faked. Another idea would be to have the renter to see  for himself that the game works before he loans it out, that would mean that the loaner actually had to invite the renter into his house and I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

I don't want to give up on this idea because I really like the idea of this community effort that basically makes everything tick and I live in a very small country as well which makes the delivery so easy. If you guys have any solution for my problem, that would be great. Every idea, constructive criticism or heads-up is more than appreciated.",1

But it seems like, as time has gone on, the minimum you have to do to get users has shifted a bit downstream.  Things like SDKs and the fact that everything has an API make the demand for a new service contingent upon integrations into existing platforms and/or a certain amount of baseline features for specific markets.

Let's say you want to SaaS for freelancers to track their jobs.  The vast majority of users will only sign up if it's got a quickbooks integration, some sort of invoicing platform integration (or built in invoicing), email tracking through Hubspot or a similar provider, etc. 

I think this has more to do with the development of the SaaS market than the development of the individual markets themselves.   A few years ago, you could launch a SaaS without these integrations and get some easy traction.  But that's not the case anymore.  At the same time, it's becoming easier to make a more complicated MVP and adding an additional feature/integration is significantly easier than it was 5 years ago.",1

I'm a software engineer. I dream of using my skill to generate independence and passive income. I've dabbled in a hundred ideas over the past 10 years. They've all been niche products that I couldn't get to market.

This year, enter idea XY. It solves a problem for me, so I thought it should exist. It's a novel way of X; one of those ""it's like X for Y"" things. I built a proof of concept and I use it every day. It's been a game changer for me, I think it would be for others, too. It's a crowded product space, but nobody's hit the mark the way I think I have. I see innovation in this space and I'm worried someone else will think of XY before I get to market. I never needed XY to be mass market, but the more I work on it and use it, the bigger it feels.

My original plan was to build XY for myself, then invite some close friends and family to test it, and validate my idea that way. Then I realized I needed a core component that would take me too long to learn and write myself, so I am in the middle of working with a freelancer for that. Then what about platforms A and B? What about marketing, copyright, trademark, privacy compliance? What if I get to market too late, or when I get there, I'm not ready to scale and a bigger fish swats me out of existence?

I'm the CTO and the other guy is the CEO who came up with the idea.

I've basically got the build the entire MVP myself which is fine, but I have a full time job as a director of my own company, contacting for various companies in the UK on 3-12 month assignments as a Software Engineer.

During my youth, I was foolish enough to splash a lot of cash on credit cards and loans, and now I have debts of circa 30-45k, which monthly is somewhere between £1000 and £1250. Estimate is that it'll be all paid off within the next 2-3 years.

I need to keep my full time work up, but if I could I'd love to switch to going full time on this, but I just can't.

I'd have no problem working on this full time for 3-12 months if I was to take the same rate as what I contract for (£350per day or maybe less) assuming the business has any money to pay for it but it doesn't. We're very early stages.

I have zero savings also.

The CEO claims he's full time, but really he's actually working on other projects as well as this during the day, and on top of that already has a bunch of savings to keep himself going for a while.

My idea is that (and from what I've read, it's not a good one) investors won't touch a company that has one part time co-founder, therefore I'd go full-time using the money we get from investment to go towards my salary.

Part time to me is between 20 and 40 hours per week, reliably but I can't commit to office hours. According to what I've read, full time is 30 hours per week and upwards.

If I'm able to commit to 30 hours per week, do you think investors would consider me full time?

Do I somehow have to pay off my debt, downsize my family home to a smaller one (we rent) and take a huge pay cut just to be able to 'start' building a company?

Unless you've got savings, or you're fresh out of college/university and live with your parents, how on earth can anyone do this if investors won't touch part time co-founders?!

If that's the case I'd rather work for years without investment part time to build up a revenue stream independently.

Is what I'm hoping for a possibility as far as investors are concerned? Has anyone else experienced this problem before? 

Advice greatly appreciated!

How I got my first 100+ newsletter subscribers within 36 hours (for free),5,j7e7lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j7e7lz/how_i_got_my_first_100_newsletter_subscribers/,13,1602196760.0,"Hi all!

I recently launched a newsletter, summarising books and other content to provide lessons for entrepreneurs but didn't have a clue how best to secure sign-ups. I posted on forums, asking for hints and tips - which proved to be very helpful. Overall, things were very successful in terms of my initial launch (recieved over 100 subscribers) and thought it would be good to share some things that worked for me.

# Takeaways

**1. LinkedIn**

Because LinkedIn is meant to be a professional network, this was a great help for me - and probably the source of most of my initial sign-ups. One helpful tip is to link the launch of the newsletter/product to your current career journey. This way, people who know you, who may not even have apparent needs for signing up may be more willing to support and engage with the post. This is helpful because that places it in theirfor their contacts to see - spreading your initial circle quite quickly.

**2. Target Audience - Platforms**

Once I had started securing the low hanging fruit, I started trying to reach my target audience - entrepreneurs. One example that I used was Indiehackers - a platform for founders to share thoughts, ideas and progress. A relevant post in these settings led to over 100 comments, 50 likes, and a good number of subscribers.

**3. Other Socials**

These were useful, but the ROI felt lower pre-launch. However, post-launch, this created avenue for sharing content. Because it was a newsletter for example, I was able to repurpose the content, and post snippets on other platforms that referred to the source. This was helpful. Placed a reference to the blog on the bottom corner of all original graphics. Additionally, I shared the first post on LinkedIn after the launch too.

**4. Distributors / Directories**

Finally, I placed the newsletter on several up-and-coming newsletter directories. This hasn't yielded a large number of results just yet but a few sign ups are trickling in over time.

# Conclusion

It's not been easy, but it's definitely something that can be replicated by others. Leveraging as many funnels as possible for any launch is helpful. That said, would love to hear whatever tricks come to mind for you?",1

Is getting a job at a startup studio (temporarily) a good idea for an aspiring founder?,6,j7cmd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j7cmd9/is_getting_a_job_at_a_startup_studio_temporarily/,5,1602190928.0," Hi,

I'm currently a second-year university student who has aspirations of being a (HardTech startup) founder one day. Obviously, my University was moved online and I thought I should use the time to get practical experience.

My planned internship at a robotics startup (that is currently experiencing major growth after a massive Series A) fell through, so I'm evaluating my other options. I want to use this experience to learn about actually running/succeeding with a startup. **Would getting a job at a venture studio give me as much insight into running a startup?**

They go through the classic startup process (research, validation, lean development, iteration...), but it still feels a bit less ""real"" than a startup, if you get what I mean.

Also, their specialty is in industries I'm not super interested in (FinTech, InsurTech,...), but I suppose the process learned does not change industry to industry?

Thanks, guys.",1

Why ideas are worth almost nothing,295,j78v41,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j78v41/why_ideas_are_worth_almost_nothing/,89,1602171348.0,"I just saw yet another post for help where the person didn't want to say what their idea is. You've probably all heard that ideas are worthless but I'm going to try and lay out why execution is everything.

I've built a business that has over a million in sales annually but covid has flattened our growth from 300% yoy to 0%. So we need to switch things up. I've got a fantastically talented team, so I worked through every lost sales over 3 years and why, formed a hypothesis about the problem. Thought about it for a while had an idea that seemed to tick the boxes and the team liked it so we started that direction. Then one day the lightening rod hit. I had a great idea how for what we needed to build, it wasn't the mostly generic thing I first came up with, it was new and it was going to be great. 

I told the team they thought the idea sucked. I drew pictures and workflows and explained all the rational and I managed to move some people to on the fence. So I just said fuck it and built the prototype myself. The suddenly everybody was like oh this is actually great. 

I have a team of people who have been living this problem for 4 years, who are passionate about what they do and super talented, yet they couldn't see all the detail in my head about how to actually make the idea work, so they didn't get it. 

This happens with things big and small. Another one from last week was after my direction, the designer made a design that was a little ambiguous the coder interpreted it wrong and for various reasons the team was convinced that the way it had been done was actually better because it allowed the user more freedom. So much so that it caused quite a dust up. Anyway to keep everyone happy we went with new user testing, they were amazed at how much new users struggled and quit the product with their way and all the alternative the users just glided through. 

It is so hard to get people to fully believe and buy into your vision for a product, it takes constant work to keep course correcting and to figure out what battles are close enough it's not worth fighting. Vision isn't a once off, it's a constant. 

Also the thing is that no matter how novel your idea is you'll probably find that there are competitors. With our first product we didn't do deep competition research, when people saw our product they had never seen anything like it and we thought it was totally new. Turned out that 2 competitors had had the idea 5 years before us. Also turned out that some people liked our execution more, so it wasn't a big deal. 

Even with this latest product when we went looking we found competition. Luckily not as well set up as us and their products kind of suck but they had the same core idea. 

I've been in the startup game for a while and it seems like even with wholly new things, if there is a set of circumstances in the world that give you the spark of something original and great, that has never existed in the course of humanity, then it probably happened to a few other people and some of those people probably have access to lots of cash. 

Execution is so key, Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social media platform. You don't need to be the first or the richest but you need to realise that you're in a race from the outset and execute to make something that some people love. 

If I can take everything of value you have to offer a company from one post, then you had nothing of value.

Edit: The point is not that ideas are totally worthless, a vision is more than an idea, it's a lot of ideas and decisions, communication, leadership BUT people scared to share a one reddit post's worth of information on their concept when asking for help. They have nothing of value to lose by sharing and in fact people can't help them effectively unless they tell them their idea.

Edit 2: People complaining about me not sharing my idea. It's all over my post history:

My company makes enterprise grade, high performing machine learning easy.

We automate a lot of the work a data scientist would do manually and do it to a a very high level of quality automatically. It's a development tool, so it's cross industry. 

Feel free to take that idea and make a company. You have my blessing.

Edit 3: I'm not saying the people with the ideas have no value, I'm saying that it actually takes a lot of hard work and time to fully communicate your vision, so the value of an idea by itself as would be communicated in a reddit post has no value, without the person who had the idea there to keep filling in the blanks.",1

So, say you have this great idea, work work on it every day, think it about it every waking min, then all of a sudden you read something or listen to something  that gives you major discouragement, something that makes you think ""ah f\*\*k it, what's the point, I might as well chuck it in and move on. Its been done before and no one is going to want it. I'm too old, its too late, The chips are stacked against me. I don't have the money. Its so much work etc""

My daughter does gymnastics at a gymnastics gym. It’s rather smaller than the surrounding competitors but I’m finding that is a selling point for those parents that bring their kids there (instead of the puppy mill gyms). The actual gym needs a face lift, help with migrating from paper to online, advertising and marketing. Bones are there, but it’s run by a man who seems tired and quite frankly, depressed.  He’s done everything himself - my husband is in IT so can handle the migration online and the advertising/marketing. The gym has virtually no online presence.  Business is mostly by word of mouth. And I can handle the day to day (being in corporate business myself).  Only one of us will quit our jobs once we go fully 100%, but at 50% we will continue to work FT.

I’ve known the owner for a couple years and we’ve had some serious conversations about buying into the business (starting at 50%).  He’s agreed to teach me and my husband the business, how he runs it, what needs to improve and so forth... and then when comfortable wants to be bought out for the remaining 50%.  We will have all the details set on a writer contract.

I’ve asked for balance sheets for last 3-5 years, full class offerings (which has much room for improvement), and business goals.  What else needs to be done? I’m new to all of this but don’t even know where to start!

Also, he is on a 7 year lease (one year 3 of 7, now) - and I’ve asked for a copy of this as well.

I’ll analyze the numbers, but from conversations I think he is just depressed and wants out. His wife is terminally ill and he needed to send his daughter back to Europe to live with his parents while he cares for his wife. It’s sad - but I think he’s just lonely and likely wants to go back to Europe and wants out of the business. 

It’s located in NY/NJ area. Initial price discussed was 120k, but I need to see numbers to see if this makes sense (I think it’s high, but I think he will go down). I think I’d aim for 80k",1

Online marketplace / aggregator - efficient solution but how to start out?,3,j6u7so,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j6u7so/online_marketplace_aggregator_efficient_solution/,2,1602117460.0,"Let's say I wanted to build an aggregate marketplace that allowed you to easily and elegantly search for licensable photography pulled from across all the different photo licensing websites. As a customer you could easily find what you need in one place instead of searching across different platforms - and when you found your photo, you simply click-through (direct link) to the photo licensing website in order to complete your purchase.

Clearly this might be a welcome solution for the customer side. But how would one go about convincing the supply side (licensing sites) to allow you to display their content with the click-through? Even without taking a commission at first, it strikes me that they would be very wary of letting a service like this take foot, knowing it has the potential to hurt their direct traffic.

It's a bit chicken and egg - you need the aggregate of content in order to feed the demand, but you need the demand in order to obtain permission and ask for commission. Am I missing something? Is this just a poor idea?",1

1. I’ve built a small business before that operated for 1 year, breaking even, during the 2008 bubble.

I was depressed for at least a year from it, and it made me actually sick running it (my arms would going numb and tingly every morning, doctor said from stress)
2. I’m much older now, that was 6 years ago, but I’m still haunted. I was working with my mom too. I guess I’m hesitant to go out on my own but I know I need to cut the umbilical cord?
3. I’ve only freelanced, I do marketing/design for other companies, I’m sick of making others money. But I make up excuses for not having all skills outside of my “department”- which leads to my question:

Do you need a business degree? Or beyond intermediate accounting knowledge? Can you base the success of a new brand on marketing and design alone? Any other tips or skills I should accumulate before my next ride?",1
Partnering with big company for SaaS product - how to propose divvying up sales?,1,j6qvau,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j6qvau/partnering_with_big_company_for_saas_product_how/,5,1602106307.0,"Hi friends!

*Brand* new to the startup world. Recently bootstrapped a very small company that focuses on making law school education more efficient, it's essentially a new study tool that we plan to sell to law school students using a SaaS model. We're in some promising talks with a major education company who wants to partner with us - my team would develop all the content for the service with a few legal scholars who are on our team, and do front-end development of the tool, and the company has a team that could do all the back-end development, plus marketing/sales/etc.

The company wants to know how we want to arrange a partnership. We originally planned on just doing our end of the work for a hefty flat rate, handing it off to them, and being done with it. However, the market for this tool turns out to be a lot bigger than expected, so we've decided we would rather take a pay decrease of the up-front price but maintain some ownership of the product and remain entitled to an ongoing cut of the SaaS sales. The up-front cost on the education company's end would probably be relatively minor, and it's projected to easily pay for itself within the first 6 months, with very minor ongoing costs after that (just maintenance and minor updates). Pretty low-risk. They've made it clear that they definitely can't do this in-house if we didn't partner with them, which puts us in a pretty decent position (but we also can't do it without them, at least not on such a big scale).

But I have no idea how to structure this, or even where to begin a discussion/proposal. This isn't in the wheelhouse of anyone on my team (full of digital designers and lawyers who don't specialize in this contract stuff).  I truly don't know if 5% or 50% is more reasonable.

Here's where my ""store"" would come into play, we would already have the inventory with us. preventively buying the merch (we would start with biggest youtubers, safe sells) your transaction would only be with us and our catalogue, no importing, no middle man, no waiting time. just like a regular store

My only concern would be the legal aspect. I would buy the the original product from the influencers stores themselves, but would I get into trouble for selling their brand? do i have to ask permision from them?it would be a small business, I don't want Jefree Star's lawyers in my inbox",1

My question is how to best decide which way to go. One route would be easier to monetize, while one route I believe would be more intuitive to users. I could create a survey, but I think it may be too complex to explain/compare in survey format. I could create a low fidelity prototype of each but I’m worried asking users to go through two prototypes and then compare them may not be worth it to people. I could just create MVPs for each since they’re fairly simple to implement and just see which gets more traction. It’s almost like I need a small, engaged, focus group to discuss it with.

My startup is aiming to provide a service that is essentially laboratory space for hire (for biotech diagnostic, medtech, other startups).

Many here will have to negotiate the handover of %x IP to workout of uni, or fork out to build their $$$ own labs from scratch.

So I'm confused at the moment about what path I should go down with developing this as an online business.

So Originally the idea was to just start working as a Virtual Assistant and specialize in things like:

* general office support
* Data entry
* Email management
* WordPress
* Tech support

But at the moment I'm looking at it more like:

* WordPress
* Techsupport
* Email management

Now, these are obviously both long term goals especially the second one.

In general, I guess my question should be. Do I stay as a VA? Or do I specialize and go down the WordPress route? And patently offer tech support further down the track.

I'm after advice on what would be the better path to go down. I will have more information soon when I have a proper business plan put together.

EDIT: I forgot to add how much would a business like this cost to set up and run before you start to make money?

A competitor is threatening legal action over trademark use in SEO and website files...

In no way can a customer interacting with the customer-facing pages of our website, or any ads we use see the competitors trademark.

I'm fairly sure in thinking it's an empty threat (we've watched his seo scores and site traffic dwindle while ours has boomed over the last few years) and this seems like a slightly desperate play.

Having the trademark in our SEO means little to us as searches for his term are almost nothing, however, I'm keen to know if its worth avoiding in future.

Impact of convertible debt on cap table,11,j57mrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j57mrt/impact_of_convertible_debt_on_cap_table/,10,1601878123.0,"Hello  - I would like to learn about the impact of a convertible debt on  future dilution in my cap table. Could someone help me with the math  (see simple example below)? I am not sure how to treat that particular  instrument upon conversion.

Assume  I own 100% of the business today (1 mio shares), that this business was  financed through a $2m convertible note at 20% discount that triggers  in 3 years time (regardless of whether or not a sale has occured).

Now, my business (an offline retailer) will be making $2m EBITDA, and be valued at 7x = $14m enterprise value.

**How will the conversion of the convertible debt impact my cap table?**

I'm  (probably wrongly) assuming that equity value = $14m - $2m = $12m, and  that the discount should therefore be applied to that number. In this  case my original investor will own $2m / ($12\*0.8) share price = 208k  shares. That would mean now 1.208mio shares exist, which at a $12 share  price implies a valuation of > than $14m!

Advice on how to cope with the transition from a big corp to a start-up,26,j56hwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j56hwq/advice_on_how_to_cope_with_the_transition_from_a/,15,1601874032.0,"I joined a startup/scaleup a few weeks ago and I'm already disappointed and angry at how things are done. To give you some.context, I worked at a big Fortune 100 company for a decade, but became frustrated with the bureaucracy, inflexibility and general boredom of it all, so I decided to go for a small company, as there are lots where I live. 

It is way more flexible, less bureaucratic (actually zero bureaucracy as they dont even have that many processes in place) and not that boring (yet), but at the same time very chaotic, things change from one day to the next, people working there have very little experience in their respective fields, there's no clear direction. They seem to just wing it, you know, and Im used to anything but that! 

I just fear that this was all just a huge mistake! How did you guys handle this transition? Does sticking it out really help or is it just downhill from here? I feel I dont belong, and sometimes I wonder why they hired me, with so much experience, when all the others have almost none. Am I a golden nugget for them? Did they not have better candidates? Did I undersell myself? 

And pay isnt that great, either. They made it sound fantastic on paper, but im in sales, and even the manager has forecasted a much lower target (50% lower!) Than my OTE. So, in the end, the difference will be very small compared to my previous earnings.",1

BUT I wont have any reasonable funds to work with/pay devs/designers until right around June/July next year.  I have no coding experience at all, but Im a trained Graphic designer. I estimate to have around USD 20.000 .

&#x200B;

I know a few wealthy people who I have not yet  approached about seed money, but they might be early seed investors for equity, earlier than next summer, so that is something to take into t consideration as well.

&#x200B;

I have no co-founder, but I guy I know is the perfect candidate for a cofounder, he is a software engineer, with an art background but he already has a full time job, I have not approached him either yet. Might be very difficult to convince.

&#x200B;

I have about 8-10 hr s a day to commit to the building of the app until then. I can get a landing page up and running very fast, but then it will take me a few months to get an MVP out. I have no interest in becoming a fulltime coder/programmer, but I would very much like to be able to speak the language, and understand things, I think thats very important for communication and leading a team. The app will be quite complex, in broad strokes  a social media platform with photo sharing, communication, time logging, payment system between users. This has yet to be fully fleshed out and thought through as Im  just in the beginning of the process.

&#x200B;

Monetisation will come from advertisers and user interaction, freemium model

&#x200B;

what do you reckon, is is better to start collecting interest/email-adresses ASAP, and then release a MVP (that I would have to make myself) after a few months, start approaching VCs, innovation-scolarships, incubators, accelerators, competitions, build it  etc?

&#x200B;

Basically, what's  a good timeline given the parameters I have given above, ie no funds until next summer but plenty of free time and motivation to work on it.

This is my planned time frame:

uring this time I will continue to search for scholarships, seedfunding, investors  etc

Write business plan/marketing strategy etc

1. Make rudimentary Wire frame /Mock up in Adobe XD. (Learn XD at the same time)
2. Present 90 sec pitch vid for scholarship applicating next Monday (12th oct)
3. Present my ideas to a few software engineers I know, to see what they say about scope, realistic timeframe etc
4. Refine and possibly learn to export to Flutter from XD, present to 2 influencers I know on 5-6th dec, MVP. 
5. Have them try it out on 35 students at their school. Get anonymous feedback. Possibly pay the students?
6. Keep refining the app. Launch  landing page to gauge interest and collect emails and involve influencers to promote. (Combined followers on Instagram are just over 2 million.)
7. Present MVP app at art convention 23 May 2021 with a few 1000 attendees.
8. Contact art blogs, etc to try to get interviews etc, marketing
9. Scale, refine, rinse repeat.
If I manage to get scholarships or if the software engineer is interesting to become a cofounder I will of course use that, but right now I have to assume that I will be going it alone until I get something to market.",1

Is there an accelerator out there that invests in startups pre revenue/early concept or prototype? I understand this does happen but usually with individuals that are extremely qualified. Would be cool to see an investor doing this at scale.

Need advice for starting up a software house,0,j4p225,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j4p225/need_advice_for_starting_up_a_software_house/,21,1601796715.0,"Hi everyone.

I'll try to give a little of background so maybe someone could help be doing it right. I was trying to run several businesses for 6 years (some even not related with IT) and failed it all. No big deal. Survivorship bias works correctly.

Recently I was trying to make a product/app. I made an MVP (or maybe a little more than MVP, but still small). Failed because I had no plan. If I knew things I know now, I probably would not do it at all. I've spent lots of time, effort but it had to fail.

I've realized some things:

First: Maybe I'm not as good as I thought with finding a niche and devise potential users needs.

Second: It's almost impossible to do it alone (with real amount of time). Developing stuff is great and so, but there is so much work to do around it like, marketing, law, design, etc. So I couldn't handle it all alone. Finding right people to invest their time for this project also failed.

I've turned different way. I'm working as a software developer. Have been working in companies of all sizes (corp, mid, small). Now trying to run a software house.

First client: old friend that have nice running transportation company. I've used previous talked app as a lever. He ordered a website. Maybe it's not what I wanted to do, but has to start with something. I've got another order for the website from him, and some small improvements. I've earned a tiny amount of money (20% of my current salary), used to pay taxes and give me some time to learn how to manage the business administration stuff.

Partners: Tried to convince developers interested in business I know, but they don't get the idea of undertaking. They want to make a project, take huge money and go out of this. No huge money guaranteed? They are out.

Help: Unfortunately I can't depend on anyone I know in the matter of creating a software house.

Alright. To the point. Doing static websites is not a good road to create a software house. There is more graphical and SEO work to do than doing something functional for business processes. Right now I'm considering these options I want to know your opinions:

1. Sales training of cold mailing, managing sales, reaching decision-makers and things like that.
2. Find a salesperson and share equity. But It might be very hard or event close to impossible to find someone, who would sell software services of pretty new company without team, portfolio etc.

But whatever I take, I don't know how to convince anyone to take my company's services. I have no team (of course I would hire with first higher contract). Just a skill set to make a business software from 0 to end, and all related stuff like analysis, processes automation, managing people and project etc.

Thanks for any comments in advance.",1
Importance of UI for Enterprise Software?,2,j4or76,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j4or76/importance_of_ui_for_enterprise_software/,6,1601795498.0,"What are people's opinion on the importance of UI for enterprise SAAS products?

On the one hand, I have read that design and user experience is one of the most important aspects of SaaS. And that good design will go a long way to not only convert customers but also help them engage with your product and retain customers.

On the other hand, I have read that you should deploy with minimal design. And that if it looks better than Windows 95, it looks better than most of the existing enterprise software.

Would be interested to hear this community's opinion please.

I would also like to understand how difficult it is to change the design after you have started writing code and launched a product (I am still in design/prototype stage at the moment).

UPDATE: Pre-launch landing page post-ad campaign data and the way forward,6,j4ib59,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j4ib59/update_prelaunch_landing_page_postad_campaign/,4,1601772319.0,"About three weeks ago, I've posted early conversion rate stats from an ad campaign and a pre-launch landing page. Here is the original post  [Is this a good pre-launch landing page conversion rate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/isswz9/is_this_a_good_prelaunch_landing_page_conversion/) . Back then I had run the ad campaign for almost 2 weeks.

Now that a full month has passed (which is the period I had planned on running the ads for), here is a detailed report on how things shaped up for the full period. Hopefully this could give some insights to people in the same stage.

# Quick reminder on the set-up

There is an existing dominant app that can't solve a common pain point as that would require either a lot of investment or a complete shift in the way their users interact with their platform. 

I have built a landing page to test my idea, basically, the landing page is your straight-forward pre-launch landing page with the what, why and how of the app PLUS:

1. An email collection call to action where users can register for early access (Subscription)
2. A survey where users are asked a few questions and are invited to give their feedback
3. Share buttons to help those who wish spread the word about the app

The app would ultimately be a web-app and a mobile app.

# First of all, the ads

As I explained in the previous post, I decided to run the ads initially on 2 platforms (Reddit and Facebook) for 4 weeks focusing exclusively on the people around me. I have made it so that the exact same ads run on both platforms. On week 3, I've added Google ads as well as they were giving some free credit for newcomers.

Each ad was an image showing a phone with a screenshot that illustrates the main pain-point I am trying to solve. On Google ads, there was only one text ad running which was basically my app's slogan.

Here are the CTRs by platform by week:

||Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Reddit**|0.25%|0.24%|0.28%|0.25%|
|**Facebook**|0.48%|0.49%|0.49%|\-|
|**Google**|\-|\-|0.58%|0.52%|

You will notice that Facebook was removed on Week 4, this is because in terms of actual conversion rate once the user landed on my page, Facebook was inferior to Reddit, so I've decided to stop it and reallocate all the budget to Reddit.

The total ad cost for the 4 weeks was 270$.

# Conversion rates once visitors are on my page

Once visitors landed on my page, I kept on tracking what was happening through Google Analytics and was able to get data on which platform was performing better, this is why Facebook ads were stopped on Week 4 for example.

Below are the different conversion rates for Subscription and Survey per platform (Basically, out of 100 visitors coming from Reddit on Week 1, 4.65 of them subscribed to the mailing list). You'll notice that there is a 4th platform ""Other"", this basically takes into consideration traffic coming from share links (i.e. users sharing the landing page on Facebook or other apps) and traffic coming directly to the site with no apparent referrals (which I believe is still coming from shares as there is no way someone would just stumble upon the landing page by themselves).

||Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Reddit Subscription**|4.65%|4.61%|4.78%|5.73%|5.10%|
|**Facebook Subscription**|4.02%|0.48%|0.63%|\-|1.67%|
|**Google Subscription**|\-|\-|4.60%|0.30%|1.65%|
|**Other Subscription**|9.63%|15%|31.57%|7.40%|12.75%|
|||||||
|**Reddit Survey**|2.17%|1.53%|1.06%|1.58%|1.64%|
|**Facebook Survey**|1.72%|0.48%|0%|\-|0.74%|
|**Google Survey**|\-|\-|0.65%|0%|0.20%|
|**Other Survey**|6.02%|0%|5.26%|7.40%|5.37%|
|||||||
|**Overall Subscription**|5.18%|3.29%|4.45%|3.70%|4.13%|
|**Overall Survey**|2.59%|1.02%|0.77%|1.15%|1.39%|

As you can see, Reddit was the most consistent platform in terms of people coming and actually signing-up, for some reason, both Facebook and Google yielded some interested people at first but very quickly generated traffic that didn't lead to any interesting action. I have no clue why it would be that way though.

What's interesting to note here is that people coming through shared links via Facebook and Whatsapp were the most converted. With an overall Subscription conversion rate of 12.75% and an overall Survey conversion rate of 5.37%.

Finally, Reddit brought in 64.36% of all subscribers, shared links brought 18.81% of all subscribers, followed by Facebook at 8.91% and Google at 7.92%.

# The survey results

The survey was a small set of required questions that aimed at validating whether the market suffered the problem I set out to fix and to what extent. It also allowed users to answer optional open-ended questions on how to improve existing solutions and to describe how the current experience is. It was answered by quite a number of people at the end.

The open-ended questions line-up completely with the issues I have in mind.

As for the other questions, the main one was ""How many times have you encountered pain-point while using the competition?"", to that one, 6% have reported to have never experienced it, all of them have used the competition 1-3 times in the past year. 58% have reported to have experienced it every single time, 95% of these have used the competition over 5 times in the past year. The rested have reported experiencing the pain point some times.

The other questions were about two ancillary pain-points. 81% of people responded that they have experienced the first and 65% of people responded that they have experienced the second.

# Conclusion

Now then, these conversion rates seem a bit low in my opinion. When I first started, I was thinking that this idea could at least have a 15% (of people who land on the page, sign-up for early access) conversion rate. On the other hand, the survey largely confirms my understanding of the problems and the expected solutions.

So, I am now in the uncomfortable situation of not knowing whether to move forward with the development and potentially fail or to just shelve it and move on and potentially regret it.

I'm a business guy by day but I'm also a Software Engineer by education, I've got strong web skills, backend and frontend. As for mobile, I'm currently learning a framework that could allow me to build a MVP. I estimate the dev effort to be around 4 months working evenings and weekends exclusively on this. Or, 8 months if I continue setting-up and testing other ideas I have.

That said, I honestly don't want to spend that much time building a MVP if there is a way to test this further without actually building it. I would love to hear what you think. Any tips on how to reach a decision? What are the things I should consider or take into account before moving forward?",1

I would like to take the existing set up and add an online presence, primarily this is will consist of bios, product information + benefits, contact us etc. All of which is currently lacking as it's a very person to person centred business which is great and I don't want to lose that, merely add on.

My issue is that while I can get a sweet website designed and operational, it looks like finding a solution for online ordering of one product is an absolute nightmare. The current scale makes the pricing of SquareSpace and Shopify unattainable, especially as they appear to insist on utilising their own commerce system which comes with fees (that are above what I can get elsewhere) on top of the £15/mo for the shop hosting.

What's the best way to do this, is it to suck it up and use a ready made solution or ask the web designer to create a simple store utilising PayPal and our bank's card acceptance platform to accept payment (if that's possible)?",1

The Golden Equation: Your Break Even Analysis,38,j48ry5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j48ry5/the_golden_equation_your_break_even_analysis/,4,1601724703.0,"I'm a 24 year old back end developer and I felt like sharing the most important thing I've picked up from my last two startup pitches. You may have a great product or service but if you have no idea when you'll be breaking even { When Total Revenue Earned = Total Costs (Fixed and Variable) }, then most investors will hesitate to fund you. As the CEO of your company, you should make sure you have this important detail in your business plan. The company starts making a profit after breaking even.

The Break Even Analysis is a simple formula:  Fixed Costs / (Selling Price Per Unit - Variable Costs)

Fixed Costs are the costs the business has to pay whether or not you sell a product eg Rent, Salaries, Building Machinery

Selling Price Per Unit is the price of your product

Variable Costs are the costs incurred in producing, marketing and fulfilling your product

Selling Price Per Unit minus Variable Costs is also called the Contribution Margin Per Unit since its how much the product is contributing to the Fixed Costs of the Business

Let's assume that our startup is Yeezy and we sell shoes. If our Fixed Costs are 100,000, our Selling Price Per Unit is 1500 and our Variable Costs are 500, then our Break Even will be

100,000 / (1500 - 500) = 100

This means we have to sell 100 shoes before we make our first profit.

This is information that gives the investor confidence that there's a return on investment.

Would love to hear more from your experiences. I felt I needed to put that out since it's based on my personal experience in the startup space here in Kenya. Good Luck!",1

It is a 1 year cliff and 2 year vest. Other than that the contract is pretty standard (i.e don't share our secrets or we will sue). I also removed my speculations on who is getting a salary vs equity vs nothing- I really don't know so I'm not going to make unfounded claims. 

I'm going to see how the work the next few months is. I'll also continue to put my foot down against the unrealistic deadlines and work expectations.

**Update 1**: Yikes, ok, these comments are worrying. I will go read over my contract again and see what I signed. I believe that the stocks are a 1 year cliff and 2 years fully vested but I need to double check.

I am also not aware of the funding sources of the company-. But they very clearly state that there is no pay in the job posting, but the full terms of stock compensation were not outlined until the job offer. I thought this could be a project I worked on for a few months, not 2 years.

I do set boundaries and usually ask for extensions on deadlines. They are not paying me therefore they are not my priority.

Also, I have 0% knowledge of startup lingo so if you could also explain terms and abbreviations in your comments that would be much appreciated!

**The story:**

So I am unfamiliar with start-up culture and work-life expectations for these business. I recently joined one a few months ago with the expectation that I would work up to 10 hours/week. I work full time and expressed my limited availability in the interview, which was not a concern for them. I was also offered stocks in lieu of pay, which was fine for me as well.

A few months in and the projects they give me definitely take longer than 10 hours a week. The work involves reviewing databases with thousands of items--it's just not possible to have the quick turn around times they want without working on the projects around the clock, which is not possible working full time. I later asked one of the managers how many hours per week are expected for my management level role, and she said that their (unpaid) student interns often put in 25+ hours, implying that I should expect the same.

The stock equity doesn't vest until 2 years of working with them. I do not know if I can see myself working this much for that long. It is a great opportunity and I believe the product will succeed once launched- but I am not a student anymore; I need proper compensation for my time.

Is this normal for start-up culture and any advice on how to navigate this?",1

I’m not sure if I’m posting in the right place. But my grandad who’s 60 has saved up his whole life to do this. 

I’m just wondering how hard it’ll be for him. He’s by no means interested in retiring and he’s very young at heart always happy to exercise and honestly looks great for his age. 

Could they be ageist towards him wanting to become a franchisee??

First time interviewing for a Startup. Lowball base salary.

6 Months of Covid Remote Teams: What have you learned?,16,j3jcrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j3jcrn/6_months_of_covid_remote_teams_what_have_you/,16,1601622142.0,"Prior to covid we invested heavily in our office environment as a way to promote social interactions and build a culture of strong interpersonal relationships: open floor plan, couches, lounge areas, gym, dogs, snacks, espresso machines, catered daily lunch, happy hours, lots of team events, etc.

We were also very strict about no regular work from home policy for the team and our CEO had the general perception based on his last company that people ""working from home"" were not really working.

When covid shut our office down the leadership team was at first very nervous about how we would continue to be productive, but I think it was mainly our fear of losing control.  What we saw happen was improved productivity in many ways and continued sense of comradery with our teammates.

**Good things we've learned:**

* We can trust ALL of employees to work at home and be highly productive.
* We can continue to collaborate and innovate over video chat and Slack.
* We can maintain interpersonal relationships remotely.

**Things we continue to struggle with (got any good ideas here??):**

* Team building fun events are hard to coordinate and execute remotely. Happy hour and game night were kinda lame on Google Meet.
* We lost our ability to whiteboard. We were a big whiteboarding team where most meetings ended with photos of our whiteboarding mess. We haven't found a replacement, but use Google docs often for shared list makings. Jamboard would be cool maybe if we all had a stylus or something? Mouse drawing doesn't work.
* New people who joined since covid have a hard time meeting anyone outside their immediate team. We are still drawing from the social capital we built back in the office and the new people meet nowhere near the same number of folks that they would have in the office.

10 major terms used by startup investors - a list created after 200 interviews with investors.,138,j3fcvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j3fcvx/10_major_terms_used_by_startup_investors_a_list/,51,1601609075.0,"I run a podcast about fundraising for early stage startups and I've conducted nearly 200 interviews with angel investors, VCs and successful founders and created a list of the major terms/acronyms that they are using. Here it is.

**1. VC - venture capital - most frequently meaning venture capitalist or**  
**venture capital firm.**  
Putting aside the official definition of Wikipedia, when someone says “VC”  
they usually mean Venture Capital firm - investment organization that  
invests in Seed+ stages. If someone at the Pre-Seed stage is saying “We  
are talking to a lot of VCs” they are right - they are just talking. VCs rarely  
join pre-seed rounds, so don’t spend much time reaching out to them  
unless you have great metrics to show them, try reaching out to angel  
investors instead.

**2. CAC - customer acquisition cost.**  
So this is the amount of money spent on acquiring one customer. It can be  
easily calculated by dividing all money spent on this issue by the number of  
customers you really got. So to calculate my Google Ads CAC I’ll divide the  
budget spent on Google Ads by the number of customers it brought me.

**3. CPC - cost per click.**  
This is basically the amount of money you have to pay your advertiser for each  
click. Facebook and google ads provide this metric, but just so you know -  
to calculate CPC you need to divide the budget of the ad on the number  
of clicks your ad got.

**4. LTV - lifetime value.**

Which is a gross income you get from working with one client. The  
description for LTV calculation is a bit long and complicated, so click here  
if you want to understand how to calculate LTV.

**5. MRR - monthly recurring revenue.**  
In other words MRR measures how much revenue you generate in a  
month. MRR is very important because investors look for its steady  
growth. One of the most frequent things we hear while talking to Seed-  
stage investors is: “MRR has to be growing 10-20% Month Over Month if  
you want me to invest”. That’s why you should focus on MRR so much.

**6. ARR - annual recurring revenue.**  
Basically the same as MRR but for the year. Important only at Seed,  
Series A+ stages where VCs are trying to see if the company is big  
enough for them. If you are an early stage startup, don’t worry about it.

**7. SaaS - software as a service.**  
Which means providing a customer with an already licensed and hosted by  
provider software on a subscription basis. The main advantage of this service is  
that you do not need to pay for creating and installing software.

**8. B2C - business to consumer.**  
This term mostly refers to such type of commerce which specialise at direct  
selling between business and an individual consumer. An example would be  
Netflix, that drives most of its profits from individual consumers.

**9. B2B - business to business.**  
This is the type of business that sells products and services to other  
businesses. An example of a B2B startup would be Unity Technologies,  
whose main customers are other companies.

**10. R&D - research and development.**  
R&D is basically the efforts that a company makes to create something  
innovative and give itself some competitive advantage.

The primary reason for why I decided to start sharing with the ""startups"" and similar subreddits is to understand what early stage founders really want to hear about. So if you are an early stage founder and you found this article helpful, please let me know what else would you like to know about fundraising for startups!",1

Bringing on marketing co-founder @2 year mark (help),1,j2pwfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j2pwfd/bringing_on_marketing_cofounder_2_year_mark_help/,12,1601513558.0,"Hi all,

TLDR; We're 2 years in with a product in the market but little traction. How much equity should I offer a marketer who can step into the CMO role?

Background: I founded a dating app \~2 years ago. We're offering a pretty niche service (the app uses matchmaking) and have a product in both app stores. While I was able to develop a pretty solid app, my marketing skills have always been lacklustre. I validated the market, signed up a few hundred people for the beta, got CAC down to $2 using Facebook Ads (currently its back up at $5), and have worked with some influencers. But I haven't been able to develop a funnel that can bring hundreds of people into the app at the push of a button.

I met a person with \~20 years of marketing experience who has been in the startup space for a long time. She seems like a great fit and is excited to join the team. Plus, she's willing to work for equity which is great because we haven't raised money. She really believes in the product.

**How much equity would be appropriate at this stage?** I'm familiar with managing a cap table so we will use a 4 year vesting plan & I'm thinking a 6 month cliff. I've been thinking somewhere in the range of 10-15% but I wanted a Reddit opinion on the matter.

The classic domain dilemma - how to handle a squatter?,88,j2npy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j2npy4/the_classic_domain_dilemma_how_to_handle_a/,132,1601506765.0,"Hey everyone!

Curious if anyone has heard of any creative ways to deal with domain squatters.

We're an HR-tech company, with Higher in the name. The 'hire' domain wasn't available when we started about 6 years ago, so we went with higher - which has a nice little play on ""elevating people"" and was fine back then... However, as we've grown, it's caused a lot of confusion. People definitely go to hire\_\_\_\_.com instead, and then see a dusty site that was never finished, and write us off.

Over the years, I've reached out several times to the owners. They are certifiably insane. A few years ago, we wrote them, and the one owner wrote back with a bizarre pitch that's too hilariously ridiculous not to share:  


>To get the ball rolling and since time is of the essence. Here is what we propose.Just this year porno.com sold for 8.8 million dollars. The good domain name is still king.  
  
>  
>We are not selling a domain we are selling a venue space for your business to get a good foothold. Like a national commercial a perfect domain name is a critical way for a company like yours to get its name out there. Commercials (ad space) as we all know are not cheap. For example a 30 second spot during the super bowl runs 4.5 million. Now we are not saying that we are the super bowl but we aren't asking 4.5 million for a half minute.  
  
>  
>Okay okay. You might be worried about where this is going. Fear not. We are also a group of creatives trying to make things happen. We can make it work at a fraction of the cost for you to rent the domain with the ability to purchase it after 2 years so if things don't work out that is all good you have the option to not buy after 2 years.  
  
>  
>We feel the domain is worth somewhere in the 3.75 million dollar price point. Wow less than 30 seconds for a superbowl ad.   
  
>  
>We don't expect you to pay this up front. As we discussed you want to start lean then purchase in a price point that we are asking for when the company is a huge success!  
  
>  
>\[name\] and I discussed allowing rental of the domain on a monthly basis for 2 years then after those two years you can purchase the domain for the 3.75 million price point. This allows you a good period of time to get your operations up and running. Also we don't use or sell the domain to anyone else for the 2 years. This exclusive arrangement requires us a reasonable monthly stipend for \[our company\] to not sell it to other interested parties.  
  
>  
>We can give you 2 options.   
  
>  
>A monthly option at $50,000 a month. This allows you to drop at any time for the 2 year span before the requirement of purchase. If you do 3 months and it doesn't work you can walk away no problem.  
A yearly option at $35,000 a month. You will be required to pay for the year with a discounted rate. You are buying not only the rent but us not being able to use the domain for the remainder of the purchased usage.  
  
>  
>So for around $600,000-$420,000 a year you will get a great domain and a way to not pay up front for it's usage.  
  
>  
>If this is something you want to engage us in we will have our lawyer draft up a contract.We appreciate the opportunity. Thanks!

  
To be clear, this is nowhere near a $3.75 million domain. Even [hire.com](https://hire.com) probably isn't worth half that. As we grow bigger, it becomes less valuable to anyone else, since they'll run into the same issues as we are with people being confused.  


In recent years, they haven't even responded to some ideas I've sent their way. I suggested some stock or even paying a flat fee or per click just to forward the domain to ours. There's been no activity on their site for 3 years.

But I feel that most popular social media platforms (FB, Instagram, Twitter) are shit shows, especially right now with the noise surrounding the upcoming election.

Personally, I'm just curious if there is a ""better"" approach for building an audience without (or limited) use of such platforms since the common advice is to continually test/validate ideas before actually investing a lot of time in them.

My gut tells me that ""yes"" it probably is possible (email marketing/other direct methods), but I'm also guessing that it's the slower route and even more work would be involved.

What do you think, is there a better way?",1

A while ago I had an idea and it has been in the back of my head since then, I think it is a great idea with huge potential.

It's a mobile app. (not sure if startups are only apps!)

However, It is not a great time for me financially, as, I spent all my savings on my house just before Covid hit and I haven't been able to recover as expected when things were normal.

So, I thought I would write a business plan and look for a private investor/ venture capital/ angel investor, as I don't need a huge amount of money.

I would like to know if you have any tips for writing a business plan, I have been reading on the web, however, nothing is really focused towards a digital startup and I do not want to make the business plan too long, as, I want to keep the potential investor, interested. I want him to grasp the idea and see it's potential.

"How Do I ""Build a Great Culture?""",2,j26zs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j26zs7/how_do_i_build_a_great_culture/,6,1601438544.0,"I've seen on Sam Altman's blog, PG, and elsewhere, this pretty frequent reminder about 'building a great culture'. 

Stuff like: 

> [In addition to building a great product, if you want to be really successful, you also have to build a great company.  So think a lot about your culture.](https://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice-briefly)

I have to say, after reading a bit more, I'm more confused than ever. I know we see a lot of posts about 'culture' in the more annoying sense - mandatory hoo-rahs on Friday at 4pm, mail order pre-printed birthday cards, etc. I don't think, when Sam is [praising Greg Brockman at OpenAI](https://blog.samaltman.com/greg) for defining company culture, that Greg is doing that. OpenAI has a couple of sections on their site that might relate, [here](https://openai.com/jobs/) and [here](https://openai.com/about/), but beyond that I don't see a whole lot. 

I think there's also the 'vision, mission, values' piece, and I think that probably plays a part here - but only if you actually act on them. 

When I think culture, I think rituals, language, social norms, etc. (like an anthropologist). So I'm not sure I'm on the same page as these folks. 

It seems like such an important piece of the puzzle, and at the same time something that probably gets overlooked by many of us who are a bit more friendly with machines than people to begin with.   


So how do we build great cultures?",1
Step-by-step process to find your next business idea!,39,j24hsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j24hsu/stepbystep_process_to_find_your_next_business_idea/,9,1601430999.0,"Hey there! 

I started the entrepreneurship game a few years ago with my business partner Vladwulf.

My main fear was to not find a good business idea at the beginning of that journey.

I say ""good"" because we all thought that our first business idea would be the one that would make us successful. And it's not. 

Actually, it's not that much the business idea that matters. But the execution. 

And we had a lot of ideas \[spoiler alert: shitty for most of them\]. 

Our process was:

1. Have an idea of a cool SaaS;
2. Make a \[very\] few research about the problem we’re trying to solve
3. Avoid making research on your competitors \[helps to think that you're the first one that taught about the idea\]
4. Convince yourself that your cool idea answers that problem \[even if it does not\]
5. Don't talk to anyone about your idea. Never. They could steal it. 
6. Spend hours on the name of your ""venture"", and its logo.
7. Believe that your product will sell itself. 
8. Spend hundreds of hours of work on development \[especially on minors details\]
9. Give up after hundreds of hours of work because the idea is finally not ""so great""
10. Go back to step 1

But I was supposed to know that.   
We all read Lean Startup, Zero to One, and other ""top 10 books to read to be an entrepreneur"". However, it is hard to extract a clear process from business books. The value is always distilled over 300 pages. As such, it is extremely time-consuming.

I've done a checklist \[500 checks\] of everything that needs to be done to find a ""good"" \[profitable\] bootstrapped business. It is not the recipe for success. Take it as a way to derisk your next project. 

Here are the key takeaways:

General principles

* Manage your expectations vs reality. Try to not jump the gun and necessarily aim at being the next billion-dollar company. Chances are high you will be disappointed. 
* Embrace the Pareto principle. 80% of the results will come out of 20% of your efforts. Don't focus on details. Kill perfectionism. 
* At this stage, you're having an idea. At best a project. Not a company. 
* Everything starts with a hypothesis. Hypotheses must be confirmed by the market \[potential clients\]. Success comes from the confirmation by the market that your hypotheses are good. 
* Spend 5x more time thinking than rushing and developing
* Sell before building.
* From inception, build your mailing list (they will be your first customers)

5 Steps process:

**1.  Find your business Idea**

Formulate hypotheses that will be confirmed in steps 2, 3, and 4. 

If at some point you realize that the idea is not that good, cut the loss.

Come back to step one.

**A. Start with the problem** \- How to find it? Identify flaws in your workflow at work, inefficiencies in a market, or simply get inspired by other businesses. Are people talking a lot about the problem? Is the problem expensive to solve? Are people really annoyed by the problem? Is it something that prevents them from sleeping?  

**B. What do you aim at?** A solution that helps you to be better in social, security, physical, economic, recognition, achievement (i.e: be more productive), growth.

**C. How sizable is the problem?** Is it a problem encountered by many people, or are you focussing on a niche? If you're focussing on a niche, is the niche ""accessible"" and open to innovation?

**D. KISS \[keep it simple, stupid\]:** Is your idea explainable in 15 seconds? Can you explain it without describing the features? 

**E. Avoid:** businesses that require high capital, volumes (in terms of users), and legal challenges. (i.e.: fintech, social networks, gambling companies\]. 

Avoid the ""I created this because I would personally use it"" approach. You're not your customer. As such, nobody cares about your opinion. What counts is the feedback of the market on your idea.

**2. Embrace the competition**

**A. Find your competitors -**  Limit yourself to 5-10 competitors. Research of G2, Capterra, Alternativeto, etc. Talk to industry experts and hear their opinion about the problem you're solving and understand how they solve it without your solution (they most probably use a manual approach or a competitor).

If you don't have any direct or indirect competitor, go back to step 1. 

**B.**  **What are the killer features of your competitors?** \- List the top 10 features of each of your competitors. Keep the top 3 features. Focus on how to achieve them in a better way. 

**C. How do they communicate their Value-Proposition?** One of the most difficult tasks is conveying the right message to the customer. They must understand directly what your product is about and how you can help them to solve their problem. Get inspired by the competition, and aggregate everything in word clusters.

**D. Identify the flaws of your competitors -** Try their product. Check customer reviews (g2, capterra, etc). Talk with their sales team and customer support. Understand why their customers are choosing them over other competitors. Discover inefficiencies in their product. 

**3. Innovate - Talk with customers**

**A. Contact the right people -** Experts in the industry, key stakeholders at companies. Pretend you're making a press article or a blog contribution about them. They will be more likely to talk with you.

**B**. **Ask them the right questions -** Try to be as neutral as possible. Don't talk too much while interviewing them (you must talk at most during 20% of the conversation). Don't ask questions for the sole goal of having the confirmation you're right about a topic. Show them a path, and let them talk about their frustrations.  

**C. Understand how they currently solve the problem -** How do they deal with the problem that would potentially be solved by your solution? Do they use one of your future competitors? Why did they choose that solution over another? What they like about the solution they're currently using, and what they don’t like?

**4. Your buyer persona**

Who will, in the end, use your product? Who is the key stakeholder that will validate the purchase of your solution and who will actually use it? (i.e: a CFO is not the buyer persona of a marketing solution). What is their budget allocated to solve the problem they are encountering? What kind of companies are you targeting (Startups, SMEs, Corporate)?  
Who would not buy your product?

**5. Put your idea into words**

This one is a difficult one. Fill this famous sentence:

We help {target audience} to {problem you're solving} by {your solution}.

\--

Don't hesitate to share your experience and we can talk about it! 

Good luck to all of you,

"I recently left a company I co-founded to start a new company, I have a funding question...",3,j246ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j246ep/i_recently_left_a_company_i_cofounded_to_start_a/,5,1601430098.0,"Hello all, I recently left a business that I co-founded so that I could create a new company. The company I left is very successful, I can proudly use that company as a reference to potential lenders / investors. Unfortunately I didn’t have a big cash out, so I don’t sit with much cash to start my new venture. I am estimating that I will need $75,000 year 1, $50,000 year 2 and potentially $50,000 in year 3. 

That $$ would go towards R&D, materials, marketing, trade show attendance, production and a staff of two employees. I would not be taking pay from the company until it is profitable. 

Here are some details about my new venture :

1. It will be retail company selling a physical product. 
2. My product will have innovations that will make it unique in the market. 
3. It will be in the same industry that I left, so I will be starting my new business with over 8 years of proven success. 
4. I already have a large portfolio of buyers whom I have collected over 8 years of networking in my industry. These buyers would be loyal to me. 
5. I own a house with about $100000-$150000 in equity which I can use as collateral. 
6. I have another real estate asset I can also use as collateral if needed. 

So far here are the 5 methods of startup funding I have seen : 

1. Angel Investor 
2. Friends / Family 
3. Cloud Funding
4. SBA
5. Traditional Bank Loan 

- I personally would like to eliminate option 2, I have not had the best experience with friends and family. Too much emotion involved 

- The SBA sounds attractive, but I have been hearing mixed things. Some people are saying they offer funding for small startups (which I am), and others are saying that they aren’t offering that anyone. 

Would the SBA be a good fit for me? If not what would you recommend and why? 

Thank you in advance!",1

How to convert more users when their trial expires,1,j1zioo,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1zioo/how_to_convert_more_users_when_their_trial_expires/,0,1601416055.0,"Your product offers a free trial but your users aren't converting when it expires?

Most of the time the worst part is that you don't have any data to figure out why users stopped using your product. Even if you reach out, feedback is usually sparse and often doesn't reveal any useful patterns you can look into.

In response to that, a lot of time and energy is usually spent tweaking the onboarding flow or marketing funnel.

But there's a simpler, better way to increase your conversion rates. Let's see how it works.

## Why a free trial is a hard sell
There's a lot of debate whether having a free trial is the best way to acquire new customers.

The clear upside of offering a free trial is that the barrier of entry is extremely low. An E-Mail address and a password is usually enough to get new users into the door. The more users you have onboarded, the more likely it is that they talk about your product in their peer groups and network (assuming it solves a real pain). Even better if your product has built-in functionalities which incentivize your users to invite others. This mix of Word-of-Mouth and network effects kick-starts the growth flywheel which will attract even more users. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually a small percentage of your overall user base converts and upgrades to a paid plan.

Hundreds of large-scale companies followed this exact playbook. Given their success it should be a no-brainer to follow this strategy as well, correct?

Despite the aforementioned upsides there are also clear downsides to this approach. Having more users usually translates into more customer support requests your support staff needs to handle. In addition to that it's tricky to get the math right such that you can use the revenue you generate via your paid plans to finance the resources and infrastructure necessary for your free trials.

There isn't a clear, definite answer whether you should offer a free trial or avoid it at all costs. At the end of the day it all comes down to the type of product you sell and the audience you're serving.

Regardless of the way you acquire new customers there's one metric you should monitor closely when onboarding new users: User engagement.

## The core problem with free trials
Low user engagement is at the very core of problems related to free trials.

Given that one only needs an E-Mail address and a password to sign up for your product it's an easy decision to take the leap and give it a try. Testing it is free after all and who doesn't like getting something for free?

The issue is that finding the time to sit down and ""work with it in the next couple of days"" usually never materializes. Life gets in the way and sooner rather than later the trial expires and your users are locked-out, never to be seen again.

Sure, this isn't always the case but more often than not people just don't get around testing your product enough to uncover the benefits they'll experience when using it in their day-to-day to solve their problems.

## Free plans and ""asking for the credit card upfront""
One solution to mitigate this problem is to offer a limited, ""always free"" plan. This way users will have enough time to tinker around and assess whether your product is worth its money. But this only kicks the can down the road as you'll likely face the same issue of low user engagement as before. In addition to that you open up a can of worms because now you have to deal with all the other challenges a free plan entails:

- Even more customer support
- Figuring out what to offer in the free plan and what to put in the paid plans
- Ways to incentivize powers users of your ""always free"" plan to upgrade
- Increasing spent on infrastructure and other resources
- ...

Another common strategy to solve the free trial dilemma is to ""ask for the credit card upfront"", meaning that users have to put in their credit card information when they sign up but they won't be charged after their trial expired. While asking for credit card information is a good way to filter out users who might never convert into paid customers it comes with the sames problems we just discussed.

Offering an ""always free"" plan or asking for the credit card upfront still doesn't solve the issue of low user engagement.

## How to solve the user engagement debacle
Now that we know why free trials and free plans are a tough sell it's time to tackle the underlying issue: Low user engagement.

Basic human psychology tells us that human beings value items more if they've spent money to acquire them. Think about the last time you got something for free vs. the time you spent money on a similar item. Chances are that you've used and valued the item you paid money for more.

This discovery can be used to inform the way how you can design your trial version to eventually convert more users into paying customers.

Rather than offering a free trial which expires in 30 days offer a paid version of that exact same trial.

Yes, you read that right. Turn your free trial into a paid trial.

## The benefits of a paid trial
Offering a paid trial comes with a couple of major advantages:

1. Only users who are seriously considering your product will sign up for the paid trial
1. It's more likely that your users will find the time to test your product because they paid for it
1. Your users value your product more compared to your competitors who offer a free plan / free trial
1. Your users are more committed to get the most value out of your product during the trial
1. Another huge point of friction is already removed from the conversion process (asking to put in the credit card information and subscribe to a paid plan)

In fact I learned about the power a paid plan can have from a personal experience. Given my growing interest in SEM, SEO and marketing in general I did some research to figure out what tools the market has to offer in that space.

In particular I was looking for a tool which would help me conducting Keyword Research, Backlink analysis and SEO monitoring. What I stumbled upon was the well-known tool Ahrefs.

However what struck me was that compared to their competitors their pricing structure was different. There was no ""Free trial"". I had to pay 7 USD to get access to the tool for 7 days. After some hesitation I decided to give it a shot and try it for the next 7 days. Needless to say that I used Ahrefs every single day during that week. The felt ""pressure"" to get the most out of the 7 days in combination with their excellent, educational E-Mail sequence helped me to explore all the values their tool has to offer. I'm absolutely certain that their conversion rates from paid trial to paying customer aren't too shabby.

## Your challenge
Do you have a free plan, free trial or are thinking about introducing such a plan in the near future?

I'd challenge you to take a step back and think about offering a paid trial instead. Your paid trial shouldn't be too expensive but it should be enough that your users are incentivized to explore your product in more depth. Combine your paid trial with a helpful, educational E-Mail onboarding sequence and check-in with your users every now and then to understand what their problems are and to help them succeed.

I'm certain that this will help you tackle any conversion-related problems you might be facing!

## Conclusion
Converting users you've attracted via a free trial or a free plan to become paying customers is hard. There are a couple of issues one has to be aware of. It's tough to get the math right and take the profits you made from your paid plans to offset the costs you'll introduce by offering a free plan / free trial. While it's highly likely that you'll get new users using your product you'll also experience an increase in customer support requests and an almost guaranteed low conversion rate.

One of the underlying core problem with all this is a lack of user engagement. Paid products are valued more than free ones.

You can use this fact and offer a paid trial which incentivizes your users to take action and explore the values your product has to offer. Having a more engaged user base helps you tackle the conversion-related problems you might be facing.

Dealing with an overwhelming amount of tasks - steps & tips from personal experience,72,j1xf9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1xf9s/dealing_with_an_overwhelming_amount_of_tasks/,16,1601407754.0,"I bet everyone here had that overwhelming experience having too many things to do. So many that only the thought about it makes you anxious. And instead of doing something, you procrastinate and watch videos on YouTube.

I was that person. It's so hard to get yourself out of this state and start working. That's why I wanted to share my experience on how you can deal with an overwhelming amount of tasks. And hopefully, helping someone.

First, you need a place where you can write down every task and thought/idea. Paper notes and note apps don't work - you'll see why. I highly recommend using Trello for a number of reasons (described below).

## The question

The question is how to cheat your brain in the first place. He's the main reason why you're overwhelmed and why you're procrastinating. You need to realize that your brain **LOVES** it when something it's easy to do. The less power to use, the better.

Once you fool him and you start some action (like writing tasks down) then it becomes easier because you're in charge, not your brain. When you start writing TODOs and your brain sees that it's not that hard to use Trello (and it's actually enjoyable) he will let you go instead of procrastinating.

## Steps for your brain

## Step 1:

To your brain: I'm just gonna download that Trello app and create an account. It's an easy thing to do.

## Step 2:

Create just one board and name it: ***My Company TODOs*** and then create 4 lists

* Backlog (everything you need to do)
* TODOs (the tasks that need to be done - it's the right time for them)
* In Progress
* Done

## Step 3:

Trello is great cuz you have labels with colors (our brain loves it when it's colorful cuz it's easy). Use the labels and create the main categories that you will use later. For me they were: Marketing, Finance, Sales & BD, Dev

## Step 4:

Start writing everything that comes to your mind in different cards in the Backlog list. Just let it out - everything. Use each card to add more info if needed - links, description, checklist, comments, etc. When you're done start adding labels to each card.

## Step 4.1

At some point (as it was for me) you might have too many tasks for one board and it becomes overwhelming again. In this case, it's time to create boards based on your main categories (labels) and move each task. Because each category had a color, you can use the same color (or image with that color) as a background for your new board. Again, it's colorful - something your brain likes.

## Step 5

Once you have all tasks you need goals. I repeat: Once you have all tasks you need goals! But why? Well, if you have four goals:

1. Getting a client until the end of the month (10 tasks)
2. Writing a blog post (7 tasks)
3. Designing a new website page (12 tasks)
4. Making industry research (6 tasks)

...and you need money - which one of the four tasks is the most important? Of course, it's number 1. You're starting prioritizing tasks. Now, instead of 35 tasks (total), your brain needs to focus only on 10. You guessed it - he loves that.

## A side note

When you start working and closing tasks you'll start feeling better. It's because you're seeing progress and results. It motivates you which will probably boost your productivity and clear your mind instead of being stressed and anxious.",1

How to find a CTO and what to look for?,4,j1t99x,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1t99x/how_to_find_a_cto_and_what_to_look_for/,7,1601386581.0,"I came up with a social app idea around a month ago that I've become very passionate about, and I think its ready for the development phase but I don't know anyone in mobile app development.

Since I've started working on the idea I have been doing some research as well as learning things like Balsamiq, Glide, and Adobe XD and used this to create a prototype I'm pretty proud of.  That being said, the app seems like it would be pretty hard to learn to code myself as I only have a little bit of experience coding.  From all the stuff I read/watched it seems like my best option is to find a technical person to partner with.  What's the best way to go about finding that person? 

I contacted an old teacher from college who is one of the founders of an Angel investing group held at the school and he says he thinks there can be a big market for the idea but I'm too early in the stages to take it to an Angel group since I don't have any proof of concept (an app). One of my next steps I have planned is to get in contact with the administration of my college to see if I can launch there but I feel like I can't get much further until I have a working app.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Happy to answer any questions if it helps understand my predicament!",1
Not taken seriously as a cofounder?,3,j1r1k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1r1k6/not_taken_seriously_as_a_cofounder/,28,1601377242.0,"I'm in Southern California and I want to found a startup soon, but I'm also going to take hormones to transition from male to female, and it will likely be quite visible that I am transgender. My concern is that when I search for other cofounders/investors/employees, they will avoid my company on the basis that they're not comfortable working with a ""man in a dress"" (as some unfortunately might say). And for those that my company manages to retain, I'm afraid that my ideas & authority will be dismissed for similar reasons.

I would much rather put myself as the CEO, since I would like a strong amount of control over the direction of the company, and I don't have the in-depth technical knowledge that a CTO should have. However, this will also make me the face of the company and may make growing the company challenging for the reasons in the first paragraph, and that's assuming the startup is even somewhat successful.

I can't find any data on (un)successful startups with a trans CEO, so I have to rely on intuition here.

How do you suggest that I'm taken seriously as a cofounder/investee/employer? (And I find my body disgusting and want to take hormones ASAP, so waiting until the company is successful does not feel like an option for me.)

Enterprise Questions,2,j1lrbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1lrbx/enterprise_questions/,1,1601358542.0,"Generally, startups can’t solely rely on a basic per month plan. They have to reach higher value contracts such as $3-5K yearly. My question is exactly how this process works? Here are my questions/concerns

- Who are the first enterprise adopters? I’m assuming you can’t just start negotiating with companies like Slack and Dropbox, you have to start at smaller enterprises? What do these companies look like, startups with Series A? Retail companies? Let’s say your SaaS company serves all businesses and types. 

- How does enterprise get priced. Let’s say our paid plan is $19/mo, would I charge 9$/mo/user on the enterprise plan assuming there are around 45-60 users? How many employees does an small enterprise start at (45-60??? or more)

- What is the importance on the enterprise plan. My goal is to maintain a simplistic UI, because we are market disrupters making enterprise software easy to use. Obviously security is a big thing, + RBAC and audit logs. what else? should there be different features for the enterprise? Should the platform look super different? I really don’t want to leave premium plan users behind just because they can’t afford enterprise or even need it. But I also want enterprise to have some features that really add strong value.

&#x200B;

A few points:

Me:

\- I have taken all of the risks so far and I am the only employee currently. I have been the one that has gained the traction and I have invested my savings into the company, savings I mainly used to pay him to create the app initially.

\- I expect the company to grow a lot in the next few years so equity could be quite valuable assuming an exit in 6-8 years.

\- I also will likely need investment if I am to employ more people, which this company needs to scale up properly, but if I give away 30% to a CTO that doesn't look good when trying to get investment (usually investors will ask for 20%+), and I don't want to end up with only 50%.

\- I would prefer to get investment and then just give him a basic salary and a very small equity stake. The problem with this is getting investment takes a long time and while I'm trying to come up with some kind of deal, the business is stagnant as he's not working on anything because I can't afford the inflated prices he's now suggesting if I don't give him equity. At the same time finding another dev would be very hard at this stage as it's a complex app with a lot of code.

\- He has built the app, but to this point I have been paying him as a contractor, so he has taken no real risk, apart from missing out on some bigger contracts as he offered me a discounted rate based on me committing to him for a long term contract. But this is pretty normal and I don't think represents risk.

\- He is a talented developer with a lot of potential and also for a software guy has a good business mind, which is valuable.

\- The downside to this huge potential is that I don't expect him to stick around until exit, so I want to make sure I don't give away 10% of my company to someone who will leave in 2 years.

**Maybe it could be a potential of milestone and time based vesting? Does anyone have any good tips for coming up with a good equity deal without too much risk?**

The Mom Test,33,j1c92x,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1c92x/the_mom_test/,5,1601329470.0,"Just finished reading ""The Mom Test"" - how to talk to the customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everybody is lying to you

""Mom Test"" refers to framing questions in a way *even our mom can't lie to us*.

&#x200B;

# 1) Don't share our idea upfront

People will lie and protect our feelings. 

Instead, focus on learning their current and past behaviors. This is a fact-finding mission, not a feel-good session.

&#x200B;

# 2) Ask about specifics in the past, rather than hypothetical / generic future

Good:

* ""when is the last time you use a cookbook"" 
* ""why did you use it"" 
* ""have you tried other methods e.g. watching Youtube cooking video""
* ""how do you currently deal with this problem""
* ""why do you bother""

Bad:

* ""would you use an app for cookbook"" 
* ""would you pay for this"" 
* ""do you like the idea?""

**Opinions** can be a false signal. We want to get **facts** to understand a user's pain point and behavior.

&#x200B;

# 3) Avoid bad data 

&#x200B;

* compliments
* fluff (generics, hypothetical, the future)
* ideas (understand the motivation behind an idea suggestion, rather than take the idea at face value)

Anchor your discussion and subtly pivot away from these.

&#x200B;

# 4) Prepare you list of 3 learning goals

The 3 most important things you want to learn from the person.

If you don't know what you're trying to learn, you shouldn't bother before having this conversation

&#x200B;

# 5) Casual coffee chat instead of a formal meeting

In a formal interview setting in a meeting room, people will tend to just go through the motion and check off the boxes. You want them to feel like they are sharing / venting to a friend.

&#x200B;

# 6) Segment your customer and talk to the right people

Don't just talk to the most senior and important person. 

*\[Personal experience\]* when my team was consulting for a mall business, our best insights of shopper behaviors came from talking to concierge, customer service, and shop sales staff.

&#x200B;

# 7) Successful learning can be ""X is not a problem"" 

Don't get married to our problem. You are here putting on the hat of an investigator: is there a pain point

&#x200B;

# 8) For B2B

Go into a meeting with the mentality of not trying to sell, but in search of an industry and customer advisor. 

The author laid out a Vision-Framing-Weakness-Pedestal-Ask framework with an example below:

*""Hey Pete,*

*I'm trying to make desk rental less of a pain for new businesses (Vision). We're just starting out and don't have anything to sell, but want to make sure we're building something that actually helps (Framing).*

*I've only come at it from a tenant's side and I'm having a hard time understanding how it works from the landlord's perspective (Weakness). You've been renting out desks for a while and could actually help me cut through the fog. (Pedestal).*

*Do you have time next couple weeks to chat (Ask).""*

\---

Customers don't always know what they want. But unmistakably, they know their pain points and issues. Asking the wrong questions - and getting false signals - is arguably more dangerous and costly than *not* talking to customer.",1

Question about reduction of stocks,2,j1aopc,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j1aopc/question_about_reduction_of_stocks/,5,1601323281.0,"I assume I need to talk to a lawyer but could use options before I start down  that road.   


I started working for a technology startup about 5 years ago and opted to take stocks in place of a full salary. The stocks are a percentage of the total, which I understand now is not the best option. Over the first few years the percentage went down by a percent or two. Earlier this year it was suddenly reduced to less than half the original amount. When I confronted my boss he told me everyone's stock was reduced as we took additional investment and that he ""had my back"" and would make sure I would get a bonus when the company sold. Needless to say he was not willing to back that up in writing. I work with a good friend that received the same amount of stocks at the same time I got mine and he confirmed his stocks were reduced to less than 10% or his original amount.  


My guess is the company is taking stocks from long time employees and giving them to new employees in lieu of a full salary. 

Questions:

* If the company takes additional investment and creates additional stocks shouldn't everyone who owns a percentage be reduced by the same amount?
* Is there any obligation to stock holders for transparency to show how much investment money was taken?
* How hard is it to fight this if in fact the company has essentially stolen stocks from me?",1

7 lessons on product design I learned after analyzing TikTok for 20h,18,j12tvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j12tvb/7_lessons_on_product_design_i_learned_after/,5,1601284694.0,"TikTok is an app that was designed exclusively for engagement. It's an interesting case study for anyone who wants to build an engaging product with high growth. I have spent more than 20h analyzing it. Here is a summary of 7 lessons I learned from its addictive design.

# 1. Build An Influencer Economy

TikTok designed an alternative economy were your views are like your wealth. And that wealth is spread between users similarly to how money is spread in the world.

The top 1% have most of it. They are the faces of the app. They inspire others to become creators and follow that path. They look like average everyday people who were able to achieve massive success, so it makes you believe ""if they did, then maybe I can do it too"".

This pushes the masses to participate in the economy and try to win. Even if the majority of them will stay  ""poor"" or ""middle class"", seeing the top 1% gives them the motivation to continue.

But only 1% reach that success, the rest of the users are ""poor"" or ""middle class"". They don't get as many views and followers. They are more like consumers, they drive all the traffic that the top 1% collects, and they produce content in the hope of joining that 1% one day. For TikTok it's great, they created an economy where everyone wants to participate and everyone wants to win.

➜ **THE LESSON: To get large engagement, create an economy where people are inspired by the top users, and the wealth is represented by your engagement metric.**

# 2. Optimize For The Power Users

Now, in an economy, not everyone participates the same way. You have to identify the power users, those who will be the most active members of the economy.

If you look at TikTok's audience, you notice that it's much younger than all the other social media. And there is a reason for that. Kids and teenagers are in quest of attention. They are very impressionable, they are easier to influence, they pick up trends faster, and most importantly they are very active online. TikTok identified that and optimized for it.

That's why the most popular users (the ""top 1%"" that TikTok promotes) are all mostly teenagers between 14 and 18 years old. They are the stars who are supposed to inspire this community of power users.

➜ **THE LESSON: Find the most active users of your economy and optimize for them.**

One thing I would like to mention here is the ethics of targeting a young audience. The younger your audience is, the more responsibility you have to carry. I don't really see TikTok trying to promote a healthy culture on the platform. A lot of it is very superficial, and if you combine the addictive design with young developing brains, you have a dangerous combination. If TikTok wanted to change that, it's simple, just change the top 1% you promote. If the top users would inspire these kids to be better versions of themselves, to learn more, to stay healthy, exercise, etc. that would change the whole culture of the platform. Issue here is that this wouldn't get as much engagement, which is the primary focus of TikTok, so you have to make a decision between profits and the legacy you want to leave for humanity.

# 3. Personalize The User Experience

TikTok uses a very powerful AI to recommend you new content. It's like an entertainment slot machine where you are always winning something.

When you open the app, you get a new random video each time, and the more you spend on the app, the better these suggestions get. It personalizes to you.

The common challenge with AI is getting good data. We already have the algorithms, but getting the data is the hard part. This is what TikTok was able to crack. Instead of presenting a list of recommendations (like YouTube, Netflix or Instagram does), TikTok infers what it thinks you will like and directly shows it to you. Then based on how you react: if you like the video, follow the creator, watch it until the end, or swipe away, they know with much more accuracy the type of content you enjoy.

On YouTube for example, there are a lot of factors beyond the video itself that influences if a person even clicks on it (like the thumbnail, the title, the number of views, who the creator is), so if someone doesn't click on a video, that doesn't tell you if they would have liked it or not. Because of that your data to make recommendations isn't as accurate.

➜ **THE LESSON: Personalize the experience by collecting the most relevant data you can.**

# 4. Create Bite-Sized Interaction

Human's attention span is short. You only have a few seconds to grab someone's attention. On the web, the rule is that when visitors land on your website, you have less than 15 seconds to get their interest.

Oh wait, but TikTok videos are also around 15 seconds long. Is it a coincidence?

Probably not. This is engineered to keep your brain stimulated. You get a dopamine hit each time you watch these short videos. That's part of the reason why it's so addictive.

➜ **THE LESSON: Create bit-sized interactions to keep your users engaged!**

# 5. Bring Real Value To Your Users

A key component that people often forget when they think about engagement, is that at the end of the day, you have to remember the big picture, which is to bring value to your users.

TikTok doesn't really do that, in fact it might be the opposite, it takes your time away and doesn't give you much in return. You might argue that it doesn't matter as long as your business is growing. The reality is that there is a business reason for bringing value as well. Simply put: people don't stay on a platform that damages them for long. If users are stuck in the app and it starts to negatively impact their lives, they will leave as soon as they got the chance, and when they do, they will feel a lot better.

➜ **THE LESSON: When you create an engaging design, don't forget to bring real value to your users, otherwise you will become an addictive product they will want to get rid of.**

# 6. Make It As Easy As Possible For Your Users To Participate

There are two ways to participate on TikTok: you watch content or you create content.

The easier these 2 things are, the more people will do them. That's why when you look at the app, literally everything is made to make it as easy as possible.

To watch content, you don't even have to click anywhere, you don't have to make a decision. Unlike on YouTube, you don't have to look at the thumbnails or the number of views to decide if you should watch it, **it's all done for you**. The app presents you the videos it thinks you should watch, and you just swipe through them.

➜ **THE LESSON: Make it as easy as possible for your users to participate!**

# 7. Empower Your Users To Generate Content For You

Now to create the content, again TikTok makes it super easy. They provide a range of creative tools and fancy effects. The video format is short too, which by itself makes it faster to create. You spend a few minutes to shoot the video, and then a couple of minutes to edit it in the app. That's it, you are done!

The algorithm will then help you quickly get views, so you have that instant gratification. More views are generated on TikTok compared to other platforms, because the videos are so short. On average, in a day, people end up watching somewhere around 200 to 300 videos, compared to YouTube where you will probably watch maybe 10 videos max.

➜ **THE LESSON: Encourage user-generated content by empowering users and making it super simple for them!**

Started 3 companies. One 3.5m arr tracking 6m+ 2021 Q3. Other business with 1m+ arr in multi year contracts. Other business dead covid. Looking to raise capital to fulfill contracts. Labor force over committed. Bootstrapped all companies.

Covid took place and hurt our original company which was essentially our living expenses and during covid our VC we had lined up backed out. Essentially over committing our work forces. 

We're at a point where the main team is working  100hrs a week but we may not have the man power to deliver on the other contracts which are very profitable long term agreements. 6fig/m profit by Q3 2021  I have drained my personal finances and credit to get this 90% completed but we might not been able to fulfill. This contract has us supporting thousands of commercial locations via national distribution company partnerships. I can't pull resources from the other company. 

I've never raised money at all and I'm concerned given the state of my personal finances affecting the ability to get the needed capital. Which we would need fairly quickly 30-45 days to meet the deadline.

I'm unsure if we should try to take just enough to get the current contracts completed with a small buffer or maybe pursue a larger amount for a reserve runway.

Does anyone have any advice or have been in a similar situation it's greatly appreciated.",1
How much profit sharing for CTO - Bootstrapped company,1,j0wqtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j0wqtb/how_much_profit_sharing_for_cto_bootstrapped/,27,1601262198.0,"\[BACKGROUND\]

I am running a profitable company that was bootstrapped with $100k of my own money. I do not plan to sell the company and never had an exit strategy. In the early stage of the company with no traction, I've approached an all-star developer to be a part of the company and he ended up declining. Eventually, I was able to get him on board after generating traction and revenue. We settled at 10% profit sharing since he already has a full-time job and he is just working on the side. We also negotiated profit sharing increase to 20% once business reaches a certain milestone. The main reason I was focused on him was because we work really well together. I value compatibility more than anything.

&#x200B;

\[CURRENT\]

He enhanced and implemented new features for the business under my direction. He isn't involved on the operation's side due to his full-time job so it is mostly me that wants new things added on to streamline our operations . The business is really taking off and we are now looking into decent 6 figure profit for the company. There is 2 of us so his share is not small given the time he has put into the company.

&#x200B;

\[ISSUE\]

He now wants 30% of profit sharing due to the value he was able to bring. I do want to OK this but this one is a bit tough for me.  It wasn't an idea that I presented to him, the product already had traction and was generating revenue. I took the risk of time and money from the beginning (I didn't get paid in the last 2 years and everything went back into the business.) I've traveled around the country to meet new potential clients, I've built a network of industry connections, etc. At the end, it's my vision, my strategy & my product. 

I know the question might be different since we are talking about profit sharing and not equity. Is 30% profit sharing too much for a CTO that is part-time? I can't quantify value or put a dollar figure to it and I factor in time spent, risk took, etc. and his share feels more than enough to be compensated while working full-time else where. \*\*ADDED \*\* I do want to point out that there were times when things got delayed and there's still new features yet to be implemented because he is busy from his day job. So people who are saying his full-time job elsewhere is irrelevant - Yes, I agree it is irrelevant if things get done on time as promised, etc. If it's impacting the business then it's something that needs to be mentioned.   


I can offer him equity of the company so he can be motivated to grow the company together but it won't do him any good since I won't be selling the company. I can still offer it to him though.",1

CEO trying to get money out of me,87,j0mwde,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j0mwde/ceo_trying_to_get_money_out_of_me/,71,1601220028.0,"Hi,

I founded a startup around 6 months ago with some individuals from India. Over those six months we registered our company as a legal entity in India (LLP) and along with this, we were told each that our details have been forwarded for 'Registation' by the CEO so that we can get equal equity. 

This was 2 months ago. Every time I've asked for an update, or mention that it's been a while, I get shot down by the CEO who keeps saying that because of COVID-19, there are 'delays'. To me this sounds like an excuse. 

I was investing in my slice of expenses until 3-4 months ago. What happened was that the CEO purchased some services such as Instagram Ads which me and one other co-founder was not made aware of.  I brought this up to the CEO who lost his cool, saying that I should not be questioning these purchases since they did not fall under my supervision and that as a co-founder I must pay for it, since, according to him, I am a co-founder. However these words are meaningless if I do not hold equity, and there are clear operational issues here as they're trying to force money out of me for purchases I have had no say in.

Furthermore, when we first launched, the CEO, who apparently started the legal process of creating a LLP told me that because I am from the UK, I will need to register as a co-founder a couple months later as it will add complexities to the amount of money that we can initially invest. He told me that his lawyer showed him the 'relevant law'. 

Smelling bullshit, I asked him multiple times to show me the legislation so that I can try and sort things out from my side, or that I can understand the situation more. It has been 5 months and he keeps shooting my request down, recently telling me that ""It's not a big deal"". I feel like he lied simply because he wants more equity for himself. This was made apparent later, when he said that he's forwarded our details for registration. So suddenly this is no longer an issue. 

Fast track to today, we have more expenses coming up. I still have no proof of equity after 6 months of operation, and 2 co-founders have just left for personal reasons. I will be quitting in the next couple weeks. Nobody has seen a shred of evidence that they have equity. 

Now those co-founders (and I) are being asked to pay for the purchases (total cost / 6 founders), which is around £150 each, even though we are quitting, and have never had equity. 

I feel like the CEO has simply delayed in registering co-founder details for equity since it has been months, and in addition there is no legally binding agreement between us. It appears that he has been delaying to get free work out of the other co-founders and I, and to get our money.

I have been paid for some purchases in the past. When it was clear that this won't be going anywhere, I stopped payments.

We now have our monthly expenses come up. He is trying to get the 'cofounders' who are leaving to pay up, and in addition to this, he said he will be 'releasing' their equity so that there is more for the rest of us. Now I don't know too much about Indian LLP Law, but I'm pretty sure that equity cannot be released by any other co-founders. So what hes actually saying that equity has not been locked in yet.

I understand that in reality that equity was never there. 

A) I have never seen a shred of proof regarding equity

B) Some purchases were made without my knowledge

C) I will be quitting in the next 2 weeks (university starting)

Only has excel sheets of plans, mock-ups and connections in the field. Holds the rest of the 5% after a slight misunderstanding with founder A and took some time off. Now back to the deal.

Startup Companies: Biggest failures of All Time,0,j06sef,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j06sef/startup_companies_biggest_failures_of_all_time/,2,1601158614.0,"This post is based on the research that I made for a YouTube video that you can find [here](https://youtu.be/uGhO4H-piN8). The numbers have been updated with September 2020 numbers on all startups.

# Methodology

I’ve researched all kinds of different sources and compiled a list of the Top 10 biggest failures when looking at how much was invested in them. I’ve done extensive research, but I may have missed something, so would be great if you find something that I’ve missed and isn’t on the list.

# Personal Comment

I made this list so that we can learn from them and avoid their mistakes. Always remember though that behind any Startup there are real people, real people that have invested blood sweat and tears into these startups. And Yes they most likely invested blood sweat and tears even if the startup ended up as a failure. Building a startup is rough, going down with a Startup is even rougher, so well done for trying!

**#10 Terralliance $358 million invested**  
Terralliance was in the business of looking for oil but in a very different way. They were using low and slow flying airplanes to find pockets of oil. A very creative approach, but I guess it never really worked.  
Year defunct: 2008

**#2 GO.COM $1,162 million invested**  
Go.com was not a traditional startup that had investments from investors. Go.com was a Startup inside Disney. I added Go.com to the list as Disney actually made it public how much was invested and lost in Go.com and that amount qualified them for this list! Disney wanted to build a portal that had all the content that Disney provided. Disney also acquired the search engine Infoseek and Infoseek became a part of Go.com

Solyndra was a manufacturer of thin-film solar cells.The secret sauce of the product was that they didn’t use polysilicon. Not using polysilicon was an advantage as it was costly and there was even a shortage of polysilicon in 2008.  
**Year defunct:** 2011  
**Location:** California, USA  
**Why they failed:** No Product Market fit

# Why do most Startups fail?

Looking at the list it becomes pretty clear that there are two reasons why these really big failures happen. Either they never find a product market fit or there is some mismanagement or bad decisions. In some cases there is both. If you ask, **What is the number one reason startups fail?** It is pretty clear from the biggest startup failures of all time that the number one reason for failure is that **they never get a Product Market fit.**

Take Theranos, there clearly was no product market fit, but on top of that some really bad mismanagement and maybe even fraud.

# Where Startups Fail (and Win)

Another interesting observation for this group is that they are ALL from the US, not one single Startup from anywhere else in the world made this list.

Actually, the geography is even more crazy. Not only are they all from the US, but 9 out of 10 are also from California. All 9 are either in the San Francisco Bay Area or Los Angeles, incredible to see 9 out of 10 are from only 2 cities.

Sure there are some really big losses here in California and you are tempted to think that they make some really bad investments in California. However, California looks bad because this is where most investments are made and there is a willingness to take really big bets here. When you take really big bets you will win some and lose some. We have to remember that the number of **big winners here is even more staggering** \- companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, eBay, Salesforce - you know I could keep going.

This post is based on my best research, if you find something missing, please post a comment.

Also, if you have any stories about these Startups it would be very interesting to hear them. Most of these companies have some really colorful personalities and leadership behind them.",1

I want people to know it might not work for them due to what their site is about, product/blog/ect.. 

There’s no telling what will or won’t work as I’m only testing it with one site atm. 

So should I offer the software for free to a few people and give them one free day using it? Build up some reviews and then start marketing it?

Half of the team, Including myself, got laid off for various reasons that ultimately were due to mismanagement. At that point I had vested a quarter of my early exercised shares. My understanding is the founder is allowed to buy back the early-exercised shares that are unvested, but the vested shares are still mine. What he did instead though, which is sketchy, was wire back money for all the shares without my consent, and ordered me to re-buy my already purchased shares. I had already been issued a certificate of ownership of my vested shares when he did this. I didn’t respond to the request, and what it looks like he did was, claimed that I forfeited my vested options by not re-buying what I already owned. What is this fuckery?",1
Database Technology Preferred for Startups,1,izqx3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/izqx3p/database_technology_preferred_for_startups/,14,1601093197.0,"Hey.. I have a question about DB Choice and Startups. 

I am a stealth founder building my SaaS product from scratch. My application is based on or needs a Document Database. My product will have a heavy cloud egress cost (think a media heavy product - videos etc). How do I decide on the DB technology based on the following factors.

1. Ease/Speed of development
2. Cost (Short Term, Medium Term, Long Term (not so important at this stage))
3. Technical Debt
4. LockIn into a Cloud Platform

I have to choose between the following Managed Document DBs (accessed via REST api's)

1. MongoDB Atlas - Charged by Storage used (mostly)
2. Firestore (Google) -  Charged by per transactions + storage
3. Autonomous JSON Database (ORACLE) - Charged by core/hr + storage used
4. CosmoDB (Azure) - Charged by per transactions + storage
5. DynamoDB (AWS) - Charged by per transactions + storage

Looking at the overall cloud costs, I am leaning towards ORACLE as my n/w egress costs are a fraction of what they would be on other clouds (big reason why Zoom is migrating some of their covid related expansions there). Plus their free tier would more than suffice my DB needs for the next 2-3 years at least.

So.. the big question:

Why NOT Oracle (from a startup perspective)? (I know their licences and support horror stories. Though, the cloud pricing model effectively stops these practices in its tracks. I have used OCI along with AWS and Azure at my previous company (large B2B org), we were skeptical at first but it has proven itself time and again.)

Which DB/IaaS provider then? 

My frontend is an Angular based SPA that connects to an express backend that calls the REST api's of the DB. I will just put my angular app on object storage and front ended by a CDN.

* Market Research: Critical and by far the least impactful. Market research is a need to know, but investors won't be overly impressed that you have an understanding of the market you operate in. Comes with the territory!
* Digital Marketing: Cheap & easy. Full-scale marketing can cost thousands, but running a few $5/day ads directed to your landing page and monitoring is cheap. Think through the suite of options including: Social Media, SEO, PPC, blogs, podcasts, email marketing, influencers, and content marketing.
* Customer Interviews: Peak validation and completely free. Hard for even the most seasoned investor to argue a problem doesn't exist if you show them +100 confirmatory interviews, surveys, etc. Not every customer engagement is going to be validating, but this isn't about a singular customer. It's about a thorough understanding of each customer's problem/context in order to best extract commonalities in order to serve the needs of the ""cumulative customer.""",1

Q1: What is the Validation Board?

Q2: I'm currently using ""The Lean Canvas"" for my startup idea. Can I combine the Lean Canvas and ""The Validation Board"" at the same time for my startup idea? or is it an alternative to business model canvas and lean canvas?

But, I'm contemplating also writing about the stuff tangential to the company. Such as, how having a family and a step daughter affect things, how I cope with my father getting heart surgery (as I type this in fact....), how I deal with having a full time day job, etc.

My goal isn't to build SEO for the company, rather it's some of my personal branding but mostly a way to just express myself and grow as a person and hopefully help others who are going through some of the same battles outside of the startup itself.

Looking for advice on what this might be classified as so I can then do proper research to find the right financial and legal people and mentors to help me. 

There are two parts to my business. One continuous sales cycle product type. Typical b2b things. Typical cycles. Room for growth, and upselling, didn't related products, and subscriptions packages with those products etc.

But the second part of my business involves much larger projects. They would be running continuously, but each project start is staggered from the next. Each one is very long term, a completely different beast, and the sales process is very long (years) and highly beuracratic involving super complex contracts with dozens of key players. Negotiations, and more. We can kinda prep to eventually do lower level contracts (under 100k setup costs), but the return on the low level stuff isn't worthwhile. We can't even begin to do any decent return projects until we have a minimum of 350k for our infrastructure / set up for these long haul beasts, and most excellent ones we want to be at way down the line will cost us infrastructure costs and setup upwards of a few million (all in, including salarys, everything necessary without me inflating numbers etc). Note I'm not doing anything new here. This is all typical for my industry. 

The first side of the day to day operations, of the typical products/sales process, is essentially funding the second one. This keeps the lights on and the doors open. It gets us up in the morning. We are, just starting anyways and nowhere near amassing enough. So, I want to boost this second side with funding. Huge returns if we do it right.

Ideally i want a pool of investors that get something akin to dividends, if we make money on those projects they do. But not equity. Or am I calling it the wrong thing. The more I collect the more diversified we can be in those huge arenas. We can't promise we will succeed though either. But we really don't want to do equity shares or convertible notes etc, these people will be funding projects not giving money to the company for equity or shares or seats. We aren't doing another round, we are doing continuous fund collections for this and we hope our success and results gain additional investors.

What other financial instruments are there? Am i overlooking things? Are we really just collecting money, creating a pool and contracts for each person dictating risk? Are we opening ourselves as a mutual fund kinda things and need to be beholden to those financial regulatory thing and I'm just calling it something else? Are they just gifts with odd contracts? 

I'm really lost at what to call this and where it all fits in in the financial world?

I'm looking for investors. But it doesn't feel like an angel or vc related type, maybe a growth thing, but it's not perfectly related to the first so it's not actually growth of anything. But it's not a seed round and the project costs are well above family and friends levels at well over 150k. 

Anyways I'm starting to give all sorts of examples, but instead let me see what you all have for pointing me in the right direction. Or asking clarifying questions. I need to learn what this is called so i can set it up right with the right legal people and financial folks and then prospect for the right people.

I'm really not sure at all how to go on about this. I was thinking of doing the pre-launch campaign for 2-3 months though as I said I'm not too clear on how to go on about launch/where to look for what to do. My goal is to get 10,000 users signed up at least after launch (that's the limit I've set for how many spaces I have available)

My plan was within those months would be to do as much as I can to get exposure for the coming soon platform... and then open it after (though allowing sign-ups before). But is that really it? It seems bland just to go and advertise it... I feel I'm missing something but not sure what. 

I have seen how some startups get going and it seems they really document the development process before launch (updates on dev. and so on), and that's also something I'm mixed up on. Before I even have an usable product ready, should I begin getting it around? I was thinking I shouldn't begin going around until I have a very set product (as in, no huge updates to make). Should I perhaps, before I am completely done with the platform, start marketing it to get the name buzzing around a bit?

On one hand, there is general support and schemes available, sales  within the franchisees stores are apparently bouncing back, and of  course, businesses won't stop printing/marketing because of Covid. Such  business may be more towards Covid related printing and products now.   
 

On the other hand, the Covid situation seems to be going backwards, many  articles about the effects of Covid on businesses (costs, staff losses,  etc.) are of course concerning, and I do wonder if the potential market  could become smaller with the amount of things that have moved online  now.

Building a Startup for a Fast Exit (8 Tips),30,iy5krp,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iy5krp/building_a_startup_for_a_fast_exit_8_tips/,46,1600874589.0,"This post is based on a conversation I had with Henrik Rosendahl who has multiple exits behind him. If you prefer to see it as a video instead it is available [here](https://youtu.be/aPGhJF3zFGc).

Here are the tips and learnings from a founder that has done 5 fast exits with 3 of them very successful. He has sold companies to Cisco, IBM, VMWare, Quantum and others.

**Tip #1 Begin with the end**

Think about **who would buy the business and why?** Who would benefit the most from buying the company? Listen carefully to the early customers and let them tell you how you fit into the wider ecosystem, Engage with the potential buyers early, not to sell the company, but rather to integrate with them and better understand if you’re on the right track.

**Tip  #2 Solve a real problem**

Release early, validate, improve, and expand the product. Focus everything on the core problem and unique IP/technology, don’t boil the ocean. **Get the product out there!**

**Tip #3 Buyers are looking for technology, talent, and proof, not revenue**

Typical acquirers are looking to add new capabilities to their existing portfolio and people who have the expertise in that area. They want to make sure your technology works in their customers' environment - preferably already integrated into their platform. A little bit of revenue is good proof, but a lot of revenue can make a transaction more complicated and doesn’t matter for a big acquirer.

**Tip #4 Have a real business model from day one**

Get real money from real customers solving real problems, it is proof for a potential buyer. Basically sell the same product to multiple customers solving the same problem.

**Tip #5 B2B is a lot easier than B2C**

B2C expensive to grow, it is hit and miss, timing and luck play too big a role. B2C is overall very risky. It can take years of a free product before a business model is even introduced (Tip #4 not possible).

**Tip #6 Venture Capitalists are not your friends**

Most startups are sold for $25 to $100 million after 24-48 months, this is not interesting for VCs, Raise money according to that. Raise $1-3 million, don’t raise an A-round it will require a +$100 million exit. Understand how VCs make money so you understand their playbook

**Tip #7 Go for the Tuck-In Acquisition**

There are 3 kinds of acquisitions:

* Strategic Acquisitions
* Tuck-In acquisitions
* Acquihire

You always hear about the strategic acquisitions usually over $1 billion, but they are very rare and typically propels the buyer into a new market/technology.  Most transactions in the $25 to $100 million range are tuck-ins - an addition of features to an existing platform, this the most likely and best acquisition for a fast exit. Finally, the acquihire - a way to hire a team with a certain expertise.

**Tip #8 Be an easy target not a complicated target**

What to do:

* Get good legal help from day one to make sure everything is in order.
* Have a savvy CPA/Accountant early on.
* Have an HR Strategy that makes people stay on.

What **not to do**:

* Don’t incorporate overseas
* Don’t have a distributed team
* Don’t do part-time work inside another employer

Please let me know what you think and if you have other tips for a fast exit!",1

I've negotiated 25% equity to join a Founder in building out his 1yr old startup.  He's recently closed an Angel round valuing the company today at $900K.

My current understanding is with Restricted Stock Awards (RSA) I have to pay the income taxes on their value today. If I were to have joined 1yr ago this would be straightforward but there's now an implied value $900K. 

Are RSAs still relevant (or preferred) here? Do I need to buy the shares and pay taxes on them up front? Or can I pay for the shares or taxes as I vest?

I'm looking to design a cloud architecture for a BI/reporting web app where I need the tenant data to be fully isolated. I'm planning on using Azure, but am open to another cloud offering if there are elements of the ecosystem that might be more appropriate. 

The current plan is to ingest data into one blob container from the data provider, merge that with prior data in a second blob container, and then enter the data into another service for analytics (dataset will be less than 1GB per tenant). I was wondering if anyone had thoughts on whether Azure SQL databases would be best for this? Is data warehousing a better solution like with Azure Synapse and OLAP? (I don't think multi-tenancy is even available there) I've also been looking at offerings like GoodData, Panoply, Kylin, Teredata, Greenplum, Vertica, and Drill. 

I'd really appreciate any and all advice/thoughts! I was hoping there would be more resources around multi-tenant analytics as a service architectures, but I've struggled to find clear patterns for this kind of solution. Thanks in advance!",1

How you can use your Customer Support system to start your Content Marketing efforts,0,ixn568,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ixn568/how_you_can_use_your_customer_support_system_to/,0,1600809272.0,"Working on your business and delivering value is important but how do you get the word out and your product in front of your target audience? The answer to this question is marketing.

Oftentimes marketing is considered to be something that should better be outsourced to an agency or freelancer. Learning just enough marketing to be dangerous takes time and effort. Plus it's tough to figure out where to start. Should you try Google Ads and PPC to drive more traffic? How do they compare to Facebook Ads? Isn't it more powerful to leverage Content Marketing these days? What are the best channels you can use to reach your future customers?

All those questions usually lead to neglecting the marketing part altogether. If you ""build something amazing, they will come"", right? Probably but most of the time it's a good idea to tap into some marketing channels to connect with your users and showcase them the value your product provides.

So what is a good starting point to get the ball rolling? Is there a time- and resource efficient way to start with product marketing today?

Yes, there is! Let's explore how you can use your customer support system to inform your product marketing strategy.

## Customer Support-driven Marketing

Chances are that if you're running a product business you're also offering a way for your customers to get support. It doesn't matter if it's a fully-fledged CRM or your own Gmail inbox. If your customers have a way to send support requests you have everything you need to start your low-effort marketing today!

What you want to do is to browse through your support queue. Look at all the questions people are asking about your product. Are there patterns or themes you can uncover? Are there any questions that are asked more than once?

Rather than creating yet another FAQ entry and calling it a day take some time to turn the issue your customer was facing into a fully-fledged blog post. The headline should be a variation of the original question such as ""How do I <Problem> with <Your Product>"". Next up you write a couple of paragraphs describing the problem in depth. After that you create section where you talk about the feature your product offers to solve the problem. This section should be followed by a step-by-step guide on how to solve the aforementioned problem via the feature of your product. Conclude your post and add a clear Call-to-Action (Next steps) such as a link to your sign-up page or a Newsletter subscription box.

Keep in mind that the main goal of your post should be to describe the problem and show a way how your product can be used to solve the issue at hand.

500 - 1000 words should be more than enough to accomplish this.

## The benefits of Customer Support-driven Marketing

Every day millions of people use search engines to find solutions to their problems. Wouldn't it be great if articles about your product show up in the search results when people are already looking for solutions? Using this strategy is a form of Content Marketing which helps you rank for search terms your future customers are using to solve their problems. There's no need to do excessive keyword research because it's highly likely that the content you'll write will naturally include the keywords in question.

Another huge benefit of this approach is that it's comparably ""cheap"" in terms of time- and resource investments. If you take only 30 minutes each day to sit down and turn one support request into a blog post you'll eventually produce dozens of quality blog posts which do not only showcase the values your product provides but also helps you answer similar support requests in the future since you can simply share the article with your customer (if they'll ever come up again).

Plus you don't have to hire an agency or freelancer which might be a more expensive option.

Using Customer Support-driven Marketing is a cheap and easy way to get your marketing machinery up- and running today.

I hope that this post was helpful for you and demonstrated that starting with marketing doesn't have to be that hard.

Hi, 

I have a software engineering degree, and i worked on a project in my final year of uni that I’m now looking to continue with as a startup. 

I’m looking at creating essentially a B2B sass. I have a good relationship with a major customer in the business area, and have agreements in place to work with them going forwards.

I think I will struggle to build the software on my own, as I will be juggling a day job as well. So I thought it would be a good idea to recruit some of my friends to help me build it. 

I only need them to help with the actual programming, I intend to handle most of the business tasks as well as communication with the potential clients. 

I don’t know how best to approach equity with them. I want to give them equity with a 4 year vesting period and 1 year cliff. They won’t be providing any initial funding. So I thought that 30% of the equity split between 3/4 people sounded fair. 

Am I wrong, is this too little equity, or is there a better way that I can approach getting them onboard?

Is it a mistake if I base my startup in Seattle and not San Francisco?,4,ixboyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ixboyu/is_it_a_mistake_if_i_base_my_startup_in_seattle/,21,1600758853.0,"Hey guys! 

This might sound like an easy question... but I want to see if I think about it the wrong way.  


Obviously San Francisco and the bay area produce way more unicorns. There's more capital, more entrepreneurial talent, more startup experience, and mentors, the law firms and accounting firms understand startups and have special offers. Talent is willing to switch companies and join you.  


However, aren't there some downsides to that? For example, people work with you for a little bit and then they jump ship to the next hot thing. Really hard to recruit talent since you compete with some crazy offers from everyone else. Your stock ownership gets diluted like crazy too, since everyone is obsessed to get as much of the pie as possible.  


On the other hand in the Seattle area. You have the same amount of tech people - 120K.   
They don't hop companies as much and look more loyal. A little bit cheaper too since the region costs are lower. You also have Microsoft, Amazon, Tableau so it's not like it hasn't been done before.  
In fact, someone can argue that you can make it even bigger since the 2 richest men in the world live there.   


So in a way, it looks a little bit easier to build a unicorn in Silicon Valley and SF... but for the right founder they can make it even bigger in Seattle?  
Is that a good judgment or totally off by a lot? :D

F-1 student OPT first year: Can I start a Sole Proprietorship business?,28,ixa6bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ixa6bi/f1_student_opt_first_year_can_i_start_a_sole/,11,1600753701.0,"Hello, all,

I'm currently in my first year OPT-post and considering starting up my own company solely, but I'm afraid that I can't do the Sole Proprietorship based on my current situation.

I did some research on it and I believe I'm in Nonresident Alien(NRA) status:

>Most typically, a student or graduate in F-1 status that has been in the US for less than 5 years will be considered an **NRA** for tax purposes. Students in the US for more than 5 years are usually considered Residents for tax purposes.

I also did research on [below](https://www.immigration-america.com/can-an-international-student-be-self-employed-or-set-up-a-company-in-the-united-states):

>Conceivably, the student could even set up the business as a sole proprietorship.  The student would have to obtain the necessary certificate of incorporation and or LLC organization, and, in the case of any form of business entity, including a sole proprietorship, the student will also have to apply for and obtain a federal employer identification number (FEIN).  For all business purposes, the student should set up and maintain separate business bank accounts, using the company name and FEIN.  All company revenue and expenses should be segregated from the student’s personal, school, and living expenses.  
However, as stated above, the company cannot pay the student a salary or a wage.  While the company can declare dividends or profits, there is an open question as to whether the disbursement of such dividends or profits to the student might constitute impermissible income under the immigration act.  However, please note that there is no statutory or case law authority directly on point on this issue.

How do you deal with slow freelancers?,0,ix7hbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ix7hbe/how_do_you_deal_with_slow_freelancers/,16,1600745555.0,"I have had a freelancer working for me for 2 months and I have been paying per hour. 

To judge the magnitude of the job, If you were to ask freelancers to quote this job total, most would say it's around $5k and they could deliver in around 2 months. That's from what about 20 said when I posted on upwork. 

This guy is about 50% finished (tops) after 3 months and he's already been paid $4k (I pay a monthly invoice based on hours worked). Extrapolating that out, it would take minimum $8k and 6 months. Way over budget and way too slow. I'm also mad at myself for letting him get away with dragging on like this (poor project management) 

I guess the obvious answer is to pay by project not by hour. I could price up every remaining task as mini projects and pay by those I guess. But even then, I'd resent how much over budget I'd have had to pay him. 

Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?

EDIT (as people are asking)-----------
Job type: It's frontend webdesign in AngularJS. He is the frontend developer. I have a separate backend developer who has finished the backend in the exact same time period. Being intriniscally linked, they are comparable projects. It is not a particularly interactive frontend with anything fancy, in this case backend is for sure more work than front given the backend business logic and database design.

Plans: Full designs of every component and page were provided at the outset in the design software Sketch. He saw sketches of pretty much the entire project before starting.

Contract: No contract, obviously an error on my part. I met him years before starting the project as we work in the same building (for different companies) hence why I trusted him without a specific contract.

Pay: This is in not in a first world country. At the hourly rate, if he hits 40 hours a week, the amount being paid is about 50% more than the market rate for this work (salaried) here would be.",1

I'm running an online car-magazine where we review cars etc. We have existed for roughly a year or so. As I'm quite young and haven't really been in the business world before, I don't have any earlier experience with e-mails and so on.

One aspect of my business is to be able to loan cars from manufacturers to review them. To do this I have to contact the people responsible from each car manufacturer through e-mail. But I sometimes have a hard time getting a response.

We've been able to get in contact with the majority of the car manufactures in our country and in almost most cases their response is positive. But there are some manufacturers I can't get a hold of.

How often is it okey to send an e-mail? The people that I'm contacting are high up the pay-grade and are quite busy people I assume. They probably get hundreds of e-mails everyday, so I understand that getting through can be hard.

My current tactic is to send an e-mail every month or so. By this method I have gotten contact with most manufacturers with good responses. It has taken five or six e-mails until some have responded. How should I get in contact with the rest? How often can I send an e-mail without being annoying? When is it okey to bump an e-mail?

In this case by small market I mean our startup will serve a specific geographic region with a fairly small population that may not be able fully support our business venture but this isn't an issue because we do plan to do a slow expansion after we have our system figured out and scaled.,1

"An American startup that is 90% similar to mine just emerged this year, due to lack of funding in a third world country, I couldn't get to market earlier",159,iwsmi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iwsmi9/an_american_startup_that_is_90_similar_to_mine/,85,1600687539.0,"Some important things you need to know first:

\- I had a 4 year head-start

\- I launched twice

\- I have applied to a lot of accelerators, including Y-combinator which I applied thrice. I have also reached out to potential investors and prominent leaders in my project's industry to no avail

\- I'm not claiming they stole my idea, this is not a complaint but an open discussion on what I could do next

\- My location is part of the problem partially, just at the wrong place at the wrong time

\- I'm uncomfortable revealing the industry I'm working in at the moment so I won't name the startups

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I started working on a project 4 years ago and built an MVP for it, my years were spent looking for co-founders, a team, and most importantly, investors. I got non of them, it was either promises that went nowhere or no replies at all. As a single founder, I knew it would be hard to bring someone on board with the situation in our country, the idea excited them but not enough for them to put in the hard work or money.

You must be wondering, maybe it was a terrible idea? My spirit was broken multiple times but I knew it had value. You may also think I should've looked for the first users since I built it already. Well it isn't that easy, the project's particular industry requires a workforce behind it, think of it as Uber if it launched without on-boarding drivers or with no drivers at all.

I don't know how to say this without sounding like a pompous douchebag but I blame my country or people whichever way you put it for one reason, the lack of vision. The people I met almost always said the same thing, ""We aren't ready for that"", ""This is complicated"" etc.. I take part in the blame because I believe I didn't explain it well or sell it good enough. I noticed my shortcomings and worked on it. Years of iteration (for 1 user, me) currently gives me hope in beating this competition that doesn't even know I exist. I believe I have gained experience by studying the idea, doing surveys, iterating, and by launching twice, both times giving me promising metrics but not being able to sustain it due to the reasons I stated above, a team.

This year I just found a way to launch without any help, self-funded and community-driven, and then I see it, there it was on Product Hunt, by 2 founders. The feedback was amazing, for me I took them all personally without question, I was actually happy because this is something I really wanted to exist, and here it is, backed by investors and funded with 7 figures. This also validated my idea in a way and I couldn't be more happier for them.

If I had a lawyer, I know they would stop me from doing what I'd do next, but I still went with it. I emailed them to congratulate them and imply that I had something similar and would love to share my findings/research, they actually have a position open for a Lead who they'd love to have to bring in their ideas. I requested for a shot at that position too. It was in Silicon Valley so maybe this COVID situation would let me be considered for remote work too. That's what I told my self, that's what I did.

It's been over 3 weeks now and both founders haven't replied, I have mail tracking so just one of them opened my email.

I didn't disclose my findings or links nor did I tell them to lawyer up, I offered help and a consideration for a position which I believe I could do good in. I explained in the email that I understand there might be legal issues but I'm happy to cooperate.

&#x200B;

Some questions you might ask:

\- Is the idea behind the product that common?

No, almost everyone in the industry misses it, I don't think it's worthless either, just that the current model is working well and I believe it shouldn't be that way. I'm a strong believer at this as a user, the other startup's vision is also the same, they believe there is a standard to set and they did it.

\- Why don't you just launch this last version?

That's why I'm here, I'm afraid am being delusional and just need a few voices of reasoning

\- Is there a patent on it

Mine? no. Theirs? I don't think there is, I searched for it on U.S patent databases and I don't think it's could be deemed as intellectual property in the first place, I could be ignorant about this I really haven't sought legal counselling

&#x200B;

Please do ask questions, I'd love to answer.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My startup failed after 2 launches and another one with resources and workforce that I don't have just launched right before I wanted to launch a third, final time

Edit: The other startup is behind a paywall and only limited to the iPhone, mine is free to the users and has a model similar to reddit gold where the content is free but you could still support it. It is also available across all platforms",1
Cnc shop,6,iwplbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iwplbn/cnc_shop/,18,1600675807.0,"I’ve gotten a quote on a Cnc machine that I’ve used as a machinist, and it’s around 285000. I can’t see myself succeeding in the marketplace going the traditional route of getting a small cheap machine and working my way up. There is just too many shops who are all doing that. This machine would allow me to make virtually anything out of metal. I have the programming and running down to a t, I’ve been a machinist for 10 years now and have worked in numerous shops doing every step of the process from quoting to ordering to shipping. Even some marketing. I’d like to see how far I could go just me while leveraging gig workers for tasks that are typically overhead costs. For example a gig worker who is good at finding customers would get a percentage of the job profits ECT. Those kinds of things. I’d like to see just how much can be automated. The Software I will be using is heavily customizable and great for automation. being a single person shop could be the best way to truly uncover just how much in the production stream can be automated. Working in the industry I have seen numerous attempts at automation but with a vast amount of employees, you essentially get to a point where the people who can do the most automation do not, they get to a point where their job is easy but not completely automated, wether subconsciously or consciously. The incentives are just not there. 

I have multiple customers lined up through service bureaus and one significant customer. 

So with the 285k machine Wich needs 10-30% down and will only finance 150k and a 50k loan for all of the startup costs (if I started in my garage or privately purchased a house with an outbuilding) I’m looking at around 350k I need to come up with. Needless to say it is daunting. I have no idea where to go or what to say to whoever I need to go to. I know my skills and I know I can do this. I worked with a tiny family shop of 4 people and I try to be humble about it but in less than 2 years me and one other person the same skill level as me basically made the place into an actual business. We worked out of a 2000sqft pole barn in and when I left we had moved into a 65000sqft facility and had acquired 8 new machines all easily half a million. They consulted me about everything and I’m extremely bitter about the experience because they gave me almost nothing as far as compensation goes. 

So I guess what I’m missing is the skills and knowledge of the steps taken before I had got to that tiny shop. How do I find funding? I’ve heard angel investors can have pitfalls if the shop isn’t producing at tech company levels. Should I start an llc or something else. I will say I do want to remove myself almost entirely from the debt risk. I know I’m asking a lot in that respect. Is there any hope for someone like me? It’s been a dream for a long time but now with all the experiences have it feels like this could be real!",1

How often do solo non-technical entrepreneurs who have to hire a developer succeed?,9,iwlwts,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iwlwts/how_often_do_solo_nontechnical_entrepreneurs_who/,19,1600663647.0,"I'm wondering how I should move forward:  whether I should try to find a replacement CTO/co-founder to be partners with or just hire a dev from an outsourcing platform. I'm starting to realize talented devs don't work for equity, even if they like the idea, and the chances of finding another partner like my previous CTO are slim to none.  But I'm also mindful that releasing an app requires a lot of dev work to fix bugs which could be a bottomless pit if I just hire a dev to create the app and release it and could just bleed me dry without reaching a monetization stage, which could be who knows how far away.

As a non-technical founder, I've been working on an app for a specific market for the past 12 months.  Started with market validation, prototype, searched and found an amazing CTO/co-founder who believed in the mission, released alpha and were close to releasing beta.  All the while, I've been successfully growing the brand, gathering 1000 people who signed up to be beta testers and creating genuine excitement, buzz and support from the target community to the point where they are starting to make posts on Reddit and talk about it online.

Unfortunately, my CTO abruptly had to leave the project due to unforeseen family circumstances and I'm left with an app that's near beta completion stage.  

I've tried searching for a new CTO/co-founder and though there is a lot of interest, it gets harder and harder every time I draw from the well, and I've tried pretty extensively in the community.  The other option is to hire a freelancer through Fiverr or Upwork and go that route.  But I just don't know if entrepreneurs who end up hiring a freelance dev and pouring their own money into building an app ever succeed because it so much more than just building a releasing an app, it's about maintaining it, iterating, pivoting, etc.  And my app certainly won't be ready for monetization until 6 months after the beta release if we're ambitious.

What do those with more knowledge and experience say about solo non-technical entrepreneurs who try to release a product without a technical co-founder and opts to hire a freelancer?  Does it ever work out?

Need directive advice for tech startup,0,iwgqki,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iwgqki/need_directive_advice_for_tech_startup/,3,1600647313.0,"Hello world.

A little over a year ago I came up with an idea that over time with a few revised thoughts and refinement I finally came to a concrete way to build on that foundational vision. Merging two things I dedicate most of my time with being environment and technology I wanted to make a difference in the world. Seeing people like Boyan Slatt and Dave Hakkens and how their dedication towards making the world a better place I knew I wasn't far off. With every passing moment seeing destruction to our planet made me feel like I had a chance to step in and do something for a change.

I am working on a project that will utilize technology as a means to reward and incentivize people for participating in global recycling initiatives by building a community where they can do this.

As a non profit, my goal isn't necessarily to sell products and make profit or sell a service, but rather provide a service free to use that will allow people to use these devices publicly to aid in cleanup efforts. Whether it in public or at home. The idea is to be able to channel clean, recyclable waste back to factories before they hit waste management facilities and dumps.

There are a few major points.

1. People
2. Device / App / Development
3. Affiliates / Sponsorships

There are plenty of people who currently recycle, so promoting and advertisement doesn't worry me. As far as the device, unfortunately I don't have the funds to manufacture and develop 10, 100 or even 1000's if possible. I veered aware from mass production and turned to strategic placement to cut down on costs, maintenance, malfunctions etc.

Recently I've just acquired my EIN after obtaining my legal documents for articles of incorporation as a  non profit. Aiming to be 501c3 tax exempt. Unfortunately that's where my progress halts.

I'm still working on a logo to file copyright so I can file for my DBA to start advertising. As far as app development and the device. I have a good friend I'd love to partner with who can take care of most of the development and IT.

So once that's done I have some questions ...

1. What kind of funding should I aim for ? Angel investing, grants, shares ?
2. How can I get companies to jump on board for affiliate marketing ? Reach out directly ?
3. I'm not a greedy person by any means. Would it be smart to go 50/50 or 51/49 and have my friend sign an NDA for development since I've already decided I want him working with me ? We're long time friends and have never even officially met. I trust him and think he's perfect for the job. In the end all I want is rights to the business name as CEO.
4. What can I expect as a company who isn't flipping products for profit, but rather building a community and using ad sponsorship and affiliate marketing ? Employment numbers would be low due to the structure of the company. But highly beneficial to the economy and environment.",1

Is the solution here to compete on price? You developed this feature at 1/20th the expenses of the competitor. Because you don't have this huge amount of people on your payroll, you can charge less.

Or is the solution to stick to unique features that cannot easily be copied? Like if you magically found a unique set of training data that allowed your ML model to be vastly superior - and your competitor's team of 40 ML PhD's for some reason cannot replicate it on their own.

Hi everyone!

I´m Tim from Sweden, hope you all are safe and healthy!

I´ve got a revolutionary app idea that´s going to take the world by storm just like everyone else, hehe, and I have few questions

This is my scenario:

I have to make a 90 second pitch-video for the app, for a scholarship application , and I only have until the 11th October to finish it. I have another project due on the 20th of Sept, so I wont have time to work on it until after then. That means I can start working on this video-pitch on the 21 Sept-11 Oct. That´s 21 days, but that period I can fully commit to it.

The video-pitch will be a mix of animation and filmed material. (User showed with phone, then cut to app-reaction animation etc)

I am a trained graphic designer, so I know my way around PS, Illustrator, I´ve got limited experience with Premiere and After Affects, from about 10 years ago, when I did an animated short.

No coding experience whatsoever.

I have the general outline for the video pitch.

My first plan was to do a wire-frame of the app, and show that, but I don´t think I´m quite there yet. I think that learning the software for doing that would be too time consuming, given the restrited time I have to get this ready. I decided that a mock up animation showing the aps potential features and usage would be a better way to use my time.

I´m looking for some software that has an easy learning curve to be able t do basic animated mockups of the app in use ( click icon, this happens, click next icon, this happens etc)

No fancy animations, its just to get the general idea of the usability of the app across as clearly as possible.

I can acquire any software I need.

I have a Dji Osmo Action cam for filming.

I highly doubt Ill win the scholarship, but if nothing else it will get me going on the path. Deadlines are everything, right? :)

Im leaning towards After Effects, and hoping that it will be like riding a bike, hehe.

The main question is, does there exists a type of animation software that is specific for this type of usage, that is simple and intuitive to use? Are we talking as basic as Powerpoint, or is there software specifically for what I need?

 A lot of us get way too hung up on the destination and the fact that we are not there yet.

 It is important to take a moment to reflect on a great quote from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., “The steps you take don’t need to be big, they just need to take you in the right direction”- Jemma Simmons

 This is extremely relevant to all of us in this community.  We should all be more aware of the successes we achieve every day that carry us closer to our goals.  

 Celebrating these successes, no matter how small they are, allow us to stay motivated, focused, and happy while we struggle to achieve dreams of various sizes.

 The purpose of this thread is to share our successes from the week with one another and have something to celebrate together.

 So, let us know what successes you have achieved this week! Nothing is too small or insignificant!

Alternative to networking,33,iviwjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iviwjs/alternative_to_networking/,21,1600507079.0,"The question here is if there is an alternative to networking. They say it's essential but I'm hoping there is some other way.

What I'm looking for: I would love to work for a startup as CTO/developer (I'm ok with no pay). I've built lots of stuff and am qualified.

My disability = the problem:  I'm an older autistic lesbian with no social skills, so obviously I don't fit the role that people are imagining. Specifically I can't remember who people are and can't work out who's who in the social order, and I'm faceblind.  I'm polite and nice and get work done, but it's a real disability. I can't learn to network any more than a wheelchair user can learn to roll up stairs, but it is hard for people to understand when I ""meet"" them multiple times.

What I've tried is to post a few open source projects so people can see what I've done (live links plus code) but that doesn't seem to be enough. I guess 80+% of jobs are filled by personal connections, which I don't have, but maybe there is a small corner of the universe where one can prove oneself without knowing people already? 

Does anyone know anyone who is like a ""rain man"" type autistic savant who has been recognized for specific things they can do and gotten in with a startup, even if they can't converse or otherwise be normal?",1
Looking to dilute my share holdings to find the right people so I can scale the SH*** out of my agency.... How do I find them?,22,ivhf7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ivhf7h/looking_to_dilute_my_share_holdings_to_find_the/,23,1600501534.0,"Ok here’s the deal. I started a digital agency 6 years ago with a chap I worked with at an IT company. 7 months ago, I sold my shares to him because I felt we weren’t delivering the quality of work / working with clients that I aligned with - I didn’t get a restraint of trade because digital is my craft. We had a team of 7 and built it to the point where we had solid cash flow and a core group of clients, but it just wasn’t my jam.

I’m passionate about digital commerce + cutting edge stuff, he liked small businesses - so there was a huge disconnect in where we were passionate / where we could build value.

Over the past 6 months I have built another agency that focuses on 80% digital commerce - its going swimmingly to be honest. Turnover of 35k a month on average with this looking to increase from here. The profits margins are insanely high because a lot of the work is done by me. I specialise in the digital side of things - PPC, SEO and high level strategy - mainly digital performance based stuff.

I am technical enough to manage dev ops and can use XD to the point where I can mock up wireframes and hand then over to UI guys to make them look pretty.

I have a team of devs I use (that i have used for 3-4 years) and they are “ok”, a lot of managing and a lot of bug testing - the end product always turns out good though because they do what you ask, but just dont have the X factor when it comes to development (most outsourced dev outfits are like this IMO).

I have a few contract UI guys and although the work they do is good, its still missing that 20% that takes an ok design to an amazing design. This is generally due to the disconnect between the designers and devs. Some of the best projects I have worked on is when they communicate directly and can have open and honest convos about what animation, where, how it should behave in screen X vs screen  Y - all of those final touches that make a web presence amazing.

My plan is to run my current setup like it is now to the end of the year and make a decent buck at the end of the year. In the new year - I want to take it and scale it. I strongly believe that by the end of 2021 we could easily hit the 2m mark (have done it before but with a completely different set of clientele), with a set of large retail / ecommerce brands as our core clientele..... These higher end clients always appeal to me because:

A) Larger paid budgets so the retainers are generally a lot juicer + it allows search guys to actually drill down and fine tune their craft - not work on 100+ smaller accounts that are, well, shit and boring.

B) More technical requirements for web - more complex website = more hours = bigger projects. Once again, more room for devs and designers to properly get their teeth sunk in to projects to produce industry leading platforms. Not a lot you really do for a client that has a 5k budget apart from banging up something that “works”, but is by no means “wow”

C) Way more recognition and the potential to start hitting exponential growth once you have landed a few whales are huge (there is an agency where I live that have done just this and now look after some MASSIVE brands world wide)

To do the above, I really need people who are some of the best / motivated in their field. I have worked with lots of devs who are ‘ok’, lots of designers who are ‘ok’, but the majority of contractors that you pay $30-$40 an hour to are there for the pay check and I have found aren’t able to properly take full responsibility for an outcome (I realise this could just be a bias).

Now, this isn’t a “a want the whales to come to me” post. I actually work on some worldwide brands that pay very hefty retainers. This is on the search and organic side, and I am gearing up to roll out a new web solution to them. But, before I do that, I want the right people on board.

After many hours thinking, weighing up options and and generally banging my head trying to get out of this paradox, I have finally realised that the only option to create beautiful things, is to dilute my share holding and find people who have the potential to be the best in their field - and give them a piece of the pie.

For instance, development is a whole other world and so much time is burned going back and forth between my dev team.... 

So I need a CTO / Technical lead that can:

A) Do the dev work at the start
B) Come up with a workflow and choose scaleable frameworks that fit with what we want to do
C) Help find other devs, induct them in to the fold of the way OUR dev ops works.

I will also need a creative director that can:

A) Do the UX/UI work at the start
B) Come up with a design framework
C) Find other designers who fit well with the way we flow.


I’m writing this because I literally do not know where to start with finding these guys. I believe it’ll take some time to find those that have the technical acumen but are also willing to grow this to something amazing AND can communicate within a team (once again, yet to find a dev that can communicate properly - once again, could be a bias and I could just be working with the wrong types of devs).

Advice for Managing Requests from a Medium-Large Staff,3,ivh0np,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ivh0np/advice_for_managing_requests_from_a_mediumlarge/,1,1600500117.0,"Hi all,

I'm working for a small/mid-sized graduate school and managing a growing number of websites. I thought it would be easy to find a software that I could send the entire staff as a way to submit and track website edits. I manage a small team of designers that are very outnumbered by the general population of staff and we are getting website edit requests constantly by email.

After looking around at products I've determined that I am not in need of a visual feedback submission tool. I'd just rather have some kind of interface that can help us make sure that edits have been addressed and those submitting the edits have been followed-up with after the edits have been committed.

We do have Zendesk for customer support. Would ZD be something worth using for tracking issues? (I'm only hesitant on that because Zendesk is something we use that is a public facing customer service interface). I've seen Github used for this, but I don't think Github would be good for the staff members I work with, all of whom have varying degrees of tech literacy.

Any help pointing me to something would be amazing. Thanks!",1

"SMLLC: Disregarded Entity, S-Corp or C-Corp for Start-up IT Consulting Gig",6,ivekn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ivekn0/smllc_disregarded_entity_scorp_or_ccorp_for/,3,1600491914.0,"Hi All,

I've been researching for several days now without reaching out to a lawyer or CPA and wanted to see what setup makes the most sense from a taxation standpoint. Here's the background:

* I'm ""semi-retired"" (i.e. No FT or PT job as of earlier this year, 3 months of W2 income for IRS Tax Year 2020 from two firms; No 1099s from contracting work).
* Friend of mine and I won a 6-month, $750K IT contract as our first consulting gig. Over 90% of the contract value is our labor/development (high-margin). The rest is CapEx.
* He and another friend have agreed that I would form an LLC with myself having 100% ownership and they would be compensated for work at an hourly rate paid as subcontractors (1099s) for the duration of this contract. (Reason: They both have FT jobs pulling W2s with full benefits from well known technology companies in the U.S.)
* I've formed the LLC earlier this month in the State of Washington, applied and have gotten my EIN for the entity from the IRS and opened business checking & savings account with a major bank along with a revolving line-of-credit tied to the EIN, backed up personally to me.

**Question: How best to structure the LLC from a taxation standpoint, both business & personally?**

After researching a little, it seems electing to become an S-Corp is best, but I'm not quite sure. Here's a bit more information:

* I would like to only pull what my living expenses are from the profits of the LLC maximizing and avoiding double-taxation. Though I've read how I elect how the LLC is treated, I may be forced to pay ""comparable & market"" rates to myself for the work I'll be doing which is WAY over my living expenses. **EDIT #3:** My living expenses are about $5,000 a month as a ""semi-retired"" married person with a 20 month-old kid. 👶
* I'd like to pull large amounts from the LLC profits, personally to me, from time-to-time for large purchases (i.e. properties, personal CapEx, etc.) in the most clean way possible so I'm squeaky clean.
* I'd like to do profit-sharing at the end of my fiscal year (since I formed in September 2020, I'm thinking it's best just to make my fiscal year start in September 2020 vs. as nice as it would be to have it be calendar year) but I'm not sure since my friends are 1099s and not employees... What are the tax implications there from the LLC standpoint in distributions.

That's about all the details I can think of at the moment. I'm sure I'm leaving certain information out and if I am, please yell at me. Thanks in advance for any comments, advice and flames!

**EDIT #1:** I just remembered one important note. —The primary reason for the formation of the LLC was to protect the IP from the work we're doing for the client. The LLC will own 100% of the IP for the work done from the client due to the fact that this IP might be reusable in the future to launch a product/service which will serve similar firms, but non directly competing firms of said client in their dominant geographical market, if it seems if a great viable market for the product/service we're creating exists. (i.e. #SolvingACommonProblem).

**EDIT #2:** The amount (%) of profit-sharing/bonus structure hasn't been determined yet. I don't need the LLC to generate lots of profit in and for itself above OpEx and a small cash-reserve to help with future discovery projects and small CapEx. This first go around, I would like most of the LLC profits to go to the people who successfully helps execute this client project. LLC has about a 15-20% gross shave off the above mentioned project revenue. The only OpEx is like JIRA/Asana, Slack, GSuite, HarvestApp, Quickbooks, GitHub/GitLab, Giphy, Adobe Creative Suite...

"So you wish your team was more diverse, but it's just not that easy.",1,ivcb9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ivcb9i/so_you_wish_your_team_was_more_diverse_but_its/,6,1600484650.0,"It's no secret that many startups, perhaps especially in tech, struggle with diversity. You start with your own network, and then you hire people who have the skills you need and fit your culture. Before you know it, you have a team that looks and thinks a lot like you. 

You worry about how that comes across to employees, future candidates, and investors, and you want to make your team more diverse, but when you post jobs, you get even more applicants who don't really add to the diversity of you team.

A few tips that might help you find, attract, and keep more diverse candidates:

1) If your applicant pool isn't diverse enough, don't think you're stuck. It may be time to slow down and rethink your hiring strategy. What are you doing to build the right pipeline?

2) Build relationships with the tech community. In DC, we have Women Who Code, Black Code Collective, and other groups that are helping to make the tech scene here more diverse. I don't see enough small businesses and new startups getting involved with these groups, even though they're often looking for things like spaces to host Meetups.

3) Listen to your current employees. To quote [Hillary Turnipseed, a local tech exec](https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/insight/how-to-cultivate-a-recruiting-process-and-workplace-where-diversity-thrives/), to ""create an inclusive workforce...it’s necessary to establish an environment and culture where employees are heard and valued. You want to set up a place where feedback from employees can be proactively brought to the leadership team."" By listening to all your employees about their issues and needs, you'll also be giving your most marginalized employees a space to speak up and be heard.

4) Involve your employees in the hiring process. Make them a part of your story, brand, and marketing. Put them on interview panels. A diverse interview panel will help attract more diverse talent.

5) Don't accidentally focus on just one level or position within your company. For example, hiring more diverse talent should not mean only hiring more diverse talent for entry level roles.

6) Forgive honest mistakes. To borrow from the article I mentioned earlier, ""A huge aspect of creating a good environment for diverse employees is to be aware of the pressures that minorities often feel. For me as a black woman, I sometimes put the weight of the world on my shoulders, just sort of by default. I don’t ask for help because I might be viewed as incapable.""

You might notice that these tips have a common theme: you don't have to single anyone out or give anyone special treatment to make your company more diverse. Good practices like listening to your employees' feedback can go a long way.

Any other tips I could add to this list?",1

For the past 2 years I've been merely maintaining it as I consider it's dependence on the API to be a large risk factor for the business. However, since then, it has grown organically to nearly 1M uniques / month and is pulling in a really nice advertising revenue. It's grown more without me working on it than my current full time startup. And there's a lot of potential to grow it even more.

Given it's recent growth I'd like to revisit the project and make it a legit business without being at the mercy of a third party API. Unfortunately it's totally dependent on the API and I would need to recreate it to some extent in order to be independent. And that will be very challenging.

Recreating the API probably requires forming some sort of formal partnership with a company that has access to certain data. I'm just a one man company and I'm finding it very difficult to get responses from these companies at the moment.

Any advice?


Edit: the API is the Spotify API and I would need metadata, audio files, and recommendation algorithms for a similarly sized music catalog. Presumably other streaming services could offer something sufficient if they were interested in a licensing deal.",1

I’ve posted before about having trouble getting funds. Well, it’s not getting much easier. Many of the banks and lenders don’t want to deal with pre-revenue businesses, because it’s too risky. 

I have a mildly successful (60k revenue), 1-year old photography business that offers drone services. My startup is in advanced drone services. Should I simply add the startup as a DBA to the business I already have established? It’s not the 2 years and 100k revenue that some lenders look for, but it’s something. 

Is there an advantage to this, or should I start with a clean slate for the startup?

The Balance Between Personability and Privacy,3,iv0wcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iv0wcf/the_balance_between_personability_and_privacy/,2,1600439231.0,"Hi All,

I'm getting ready to launch my  product -- a b2c Saas product --  and something I've been thinking about is how to strike a balance between privacy and personability.

With my launch coming up, that means the bulk of the developing is out of the way, and it'll be time to turn more towards marketing and getting the word out there, which means posting on different forums and sites and sharing what I've done.

I would think there's a great benefit to sharing your real name (depending on the forum) and also sharing your product on accounts linked to your real name (like social media accounts, etc). However, I'm a pretty private person and have no desire in becoming famous, and given the choice, I would definitely prefer not to be. Not that I think my product is necessarily going to make me ""famous"", but I mean I'd prefer not to have my name and image out there if at all possible. 

&#x200B;

How do you think about this distinction and handle privacy when promoting and speaking about your own companies? Do you willingly promote your products with your real identity, or do you take another approach? 

I'd love to hear some of your prospectives and experiences.",1
What are your thoughts on a culture of infrequent meetings and strong and transparent KPI tracking and reporting? Who should be in charge of managing KPI reporting org wide? And other questions...,59,iux4uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iux4uk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_culture_of_infrequent/,67,1600422714.0,"Few questions:

1. All functions have different ways of measuring performance and supposing that each is in charge of tracking and reporting them, who is in charge of collecting it all and also company wide metrics neatly for C-level to view? Would this be a head of operations? 

2. What are your views on full transparency across the organization of each individuals performance per their roles KPIs? 

3. I’ve been surprised when hiring that juniors need very clear instructions on what KPIs I need to know about, and that they need to report them regularly, easy to read, and without prompting. I thought this was normal. Do other companies not do this/is this nonstandard? 

4. I should add that I don’t do morning stand ups or daily or even weekly syncs, expecting that we have a meeting where I outline the work, they come back presenting what they did when ready, and then we repeat. I’ve found however that this workflow, just doesn’t seem known by new hires in the past. Like they lacked direction and weren’t asking for what they need or expecting to give an update from our last meeting next time we meet. Again, I thought this was normal. Do people not expect to give regular updates on their work and ask for what they need? 

5. I’d like to avoid meetings for the sake of meetings but am getting the sense I underestimate how much communication is needed for the individual steps of a project. What are your thoughts on a culture of infrequent meetings and a lot of reporting all can see? Pros and cons? I know there are parts of performance and satisfaction which can’t be measured and I check in manually once in awhile and think a monthly catchup without a topic is reasonable.

What is the better plan to build it: Get a technical co-founder to build it or do you contract out a developer for some X number of months?

They're considering the former. Is it necessarily better to have a tech co-founder as the first person to develop the MVP? 

Suppose you went with the co-founder route. Do you normally vet them by giving them a short trial period to see if are good co-founder material? Or is it uncommon to do that? They are trying to do that, to get a feel for someone for about 4-6 weeks before they can be sure, of ""this is the person I want to move my company forward with."" 

I'm arguing more against it. My clearest argument to them is that they're slicing up the pie way too quickly, and getting a contractor can concentrate all their focus on delivering the MVP.

Instead the student hears ""chocolatier"" and only wants to shadow on a production day. Absolutely not. My production days are intense and can't be interrupted. Besides, it's actually the most uninteresting part of the business, it's just following recipes I created quite a while ago.

After I say no and explain that another day is not only more feasible for me, but more interesting (to be fair, I'm a nerd for business), they write back saying they ""respectfully decline if they can't sit in on a production day.""

Ideally, your pitch should be refined, engaging, and downright entertaining enough that everyone in the room could answer all of these questions at a basic level by the end of it. Even if someone was completely distracted by their phone at the start, a good pitch will get their attention right away. At least that's my thinking. Questions:

* What's the problem being solved, with relevant statistics?

* What's your solution? (extremely succinct and understandable, with a hook)

* What is the story your telling at the start of your pitch?

* What is your target market and how big is it?

* Who is your ideal customer?

* How will you market your solution to find those customers?

* Who are your competitors?

* How is your solution different from your competitors?

* How will you make money?

* How long until you break even?

* How do you know people really want this?

* What organization or person would you most want to connect with to grow your business?

* Why is your team the best to solve this and what is your unfair advantage?

* How does the solution work and how does the customer use it?

* What are your future plans? Is there a roadmap?

* Do you have an exit strategy?

* Are you open to acquisition?

* What are you asking investors for (money, connections, mentorship) and how will it be used?

* How well does this scale up if it's successful? How will you scale it?

* If given the resources requested, can your team commit? How long will it take to execute?

* Average cost of customer acquisition and lifetime value of the average customer?

My partner and I agreed that I will take a salary, let's say it is x amount. This is okay for me and will allow me to support my family and myself and also save up. We also agreed that in the first 4 months of me full time on the business, my salary will only be 75% of x amount. On the 5th month and so on, it will be x amount.

I do not have a patent for the product, and believe I do not need one because it is for pure entertainment with negligible utility. The product is, however, designed to be mounted on a specific product line of shoes. 

How do I go about marketing the product? Can I use images of the product on the trademarked branded shoe?

I understand that the main idea is that consumers cannot be tricked into thinking my product is made by the company it is being used on.

Think of this as me making a shoelace for Adidas. Could I call my product/company 'Not An Adidas Shoelace' and provide pictures of the shoelace on Adidas shoes without infringement?

To be clear, my product is similar to the shoelace analogy, but is not explicitly that situation.

**Longer version:** One a recent project, we had 2 weeks to complete our work. I took on the larger job of crafting branded video templates and forming the key relationships needed for the video campaigns. Her job was to create our new landing page. In two weeks time, I had almost a dozen highly-produced template options to show, but she had only mocked up a blank, generic Squarespace website template.

If this were an employee-employer relationship, I'd know what to do: Tell her to get it together. But as co-founders, aren't we supposed to be building together, not one having to train and manage the other?

How to Pitch an Idea,3,itxgv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/itxgv5/how_to_pitch_an_idea/,2,1600298084.0,"Pitching is such a critical part of any startup and yet so many entrepreneurs have never been taught how to pitch effectively. I want to change that by showing you not only how to pitch, but how to pitch so effectively that you will win competitions and investors doing so. 

My pitch framework consists of the 5 sections of a pitch: Writing the pitch, Delivery, Pitch Deck Slides, Stage Presence, and Q & A.

Section 1: Writing the Pitch

Step 1 is your introduction or your “why” and you have 2 key goals.

1) Be engaging. People have limited attention spans.You need to be engaging if you want people to pay attention to your pitch. 2) Introduce the problem. You are pitching a problem where you have a solution.Always start your pitch discussing why your audience should care. Why does the problem matter?

When you are writing your own introduction, I recommend utilizing some of the powerful oratory tools that I used: 

Personal anecdotes - “students telling me they’ve skipped whole meals” 

Emotive language -  “That’s lost money for businesses, empty stomachs for students”

Step 2 of your pitch is “the who and the how”: 1) Introduce yourself and your team if you have one. This personal touch puts a name to a face and humanizes you more, which helps with engagement. Investors and judges care about who is helping you solve this problem so even a quick introduction will have a positive impact. 2) Introduce your solution briefly and focus on how it works. If you have a tagline this is the time to use it and Make sure you give a clear explanation of how you solve the problem

Step 3 of your pitch is “the what”: What you do specifically to solve the problem? Is your solution a product, a service, or an app? This is where you want to highlight any successes you’ve already encountered in the form of users or customers

Step 4 of your pitch is about finances: 1) Introduce the market size for your business. How big is the industry you will be disrupting or helping with your solution? How many customers will your solution be relevant to? 2) Show your progress selling your solution. If you have any paid contracts, paid user, or other paying customers this is where you want to highlight your progress. 

Step 5 of your pitch focuses on customer satisfaction: 1) What value have you been providing your customers. Give a quick rundown of the benefits your customer receive by paying for your solution 2) Customer acquisition. Has your customers experience led to any further sales or expansion within their network?

The 6th and final step of writing your pitch is your conclusion: 1) Focus on your future plans. You’ve already told the judges or investors what you are doing now, so you want to provide your long term vision for your company.  What will your impact be in the next 10 years? 2) A call to action. If you are pitching to investors your call to action is for them to invest. If you are pitching to judges, your call to action is for them to declare you the winner.

Section 2: Delivery

There are 3 C’s to remember:

Your delivery should be Clear.

Your delivery should exude Confidence.

Your delivery should be Concise.

&#x200B;

Section 3: Pitch Deck Slides

Each slide should follow all of these 3 rules: 

1) A single idea per slide. 

2) The slide should complement what you are saying. 

3) The slide should be as minimalistic as possible, uncluttered, with no unnecessary text.

Every slide in your pitch deck should conform to these 3 rules.

&#x200B;

Section 4: Stage Presence

There are 4 main Stage presence considerations to consider:

1) If you are pitching solo always wear a suit or equivalent female professional wear.

2) If you have a team make sure you all look the same.

3) If your solution can have a prop make sure to incorporate it into your pitch.

4) Make sure you and your team are positioned uniformly on stage.

&#x200B;

Section 5: Q & A

There are 2 main rules to Q & A

1) Practice doing Q & A. Everyone prepares to give a pitch so to stand out you need to prepare just as much for the Q & A. Very rarely will you get a question that could not have been anticipated in one form or another. Even if you do you will be better able to answer it if you have practiced.

2) Listen to the questions and answer them completely. You want the judges or investors to feel heard so make sure you are paying attention. Nothing annoys a judge or investor more than feeling like you are dodging or failing to answer the question, so be frank and direct.

&#x200B;

If you want visual examples of what I have discussed above here is an example of the pitch I gave and won $20K+ with at the 2020 Georgia Tech Inventure Prize: [https://youtu.be/Lwg4yPgHo6s](https://youtu.be/Lwg4yPgHo6s)

Is it a waste of money?

Need Perspective on Tech Startup Role Conflict,1,ittrge,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ittrge/need_perspective_on_tech_startup_role_conflict/,13,1600285133.0,"I was initially approached by my co-founder, let's call him Joe, so Joe approached me with a very crude idea for a product.

I was interested, because if refined, this product looked promising to me. He wanted my expertise in tech, to actually build this product.

Over time, I gave much more than my expertise in tech. Not only did I build the product, but my contributions led to us pivoting significantly. We had a very different product now than initially planned, and most of the revenue model, as well aa a completely different set of features was designed by me.

We had not discussed roles earlier, which I think was a big mistake.

Now, he wants me to be CTO while he stays CEO.


We're a tech startup and the CEO (Joe) doesn't know tech. But the CTO (me) knows both the business and the tech.

I made it very clear that this felt unfair to me. So he now wants to call me ""Tech Executive"" while he will be the ""Business Executive"". 

I still feel this is a little problematic. Most of the questions that we get from users or potential investors, whether they are related to tech, or our company's vision, are answered by me.

Joe does handle day to day operations, and he talks to the rest of the team and gets stuff done, because I'm generally busy handling the tech.

However, instructions for most of what needs to happen comes from me. I don't have the time to direct the team, so he is the one who makes sure my instructions are executed.

The two of us have equal equity. We both have 40% each. The rest of the team gets 20% divided equally amongst themselves.

I felt that the equity split was fair earlier, but now it feels a little unfair, given how much more I have contributed. However not being very concerned about the money itself, I am not bothered enough to talk about equity with him.

I really don't care about the title. But I don't want him to take credit for my work. And I want to ensure that in the future too, I can give shape to the company's vision, and I am free to take executive decisions.

So basically I need to know:

1) Whether I'm wrong here, or am I really being treated unfairly.

2) Is there a hierarchical role setup that would suit our company better than CEO-CTO?",1

Question about calculating Joint Venture equity,2,itrh2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/itrh2t/question_about_calculating_joint_venture_equity/,2,1600272634.0,"Hello all. I've created a SaaS product, and am discussing with a potential partner over entering into a joint venture. The partner is a corporation, who will provide access to resources and funding. I'm trying to wrap my head around how much value each of us is bringing, in order to determine an approximate equity share

&#x200B;

I've broken the project into components (Ex. Software, Marketing, Legal/Accounting, etc.) . Each of these components, I've broken down into

1. Initial Value (what is brought to the table at the outset of the venture), and
2. Ongoing value (work that is promised, value estimated annually)

Initial value, conceptually, is simple. I am lost with ongoing value - if a service that I estimate at $50k/year is being included as part of the JV agreement, how would that compare to, say, a $100k one-time initial value brought to the JV?

Also - am I on the right track here?  Thanks!",1

I just take cash because options never turn out to be worth anything.""

Where should I look?

Ideas I have:

\-Reach out to our investors / advisors and ask for intros to other CTOs of companies that they have invested in that are in a similar spot.

\-Referrals from my existing network

\-Ask around at the local CTO roundtable that I attend

How do you price business by your machines?,1,iti3pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iti3pr/how_do_you_price_business_by_your_machines/,1,1600234063.0,"So the main idea is that I want to offer customers 3 fixed fee options for using a machine. The problem is that I am having a hard time calculating the profit margins for the business and machine labor itself.

My initial investment for the business is $16k. The cost for labor ( only me ) would be $7k ( bare minimum ). Overhead costs such as rent, website, and other small snips would be $2k. So for my business to operate without profit would require $9k. I would like to cover my investment with 1 year so it would add 1.3k totaling $10.3k per month.

Now I have developed a calculator to estimate how much It would cost to set up the machine per order which is few dollars ( the setup take few minutes up to 1h ), machine depreciation rate, used materials, and approx. failure rate. From using this calculator, all of the 3 fixed fee options are able to cover the costs of machine operation with a slight profit margin. So in most, the work is done by the machine and not by me.

The fixed fee options are currently just a made-up number I assume it would never exceed the costs of machine operation. 1st option would cost $100, second $150 & third $300. it is based on few factors of machine ability but nothing else.

Now the problem is that I am unable to properly mentally connect the monthly costs with the calculator and add profit margins to let my business grow. I am really not sure if I should begin with the calculator or monthly costs, and start from there to determine how much I should receive orders to cover the costs and earn profit or if I should change my fixed fee options to make it more feasible. I would also like to apologize if this made no sense. If so, I will try to elaborate it more.",1

Equity structure for my company,2,itcl8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/itcl8s/equity_structure_for_my_company/,0,1600217218.0,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I am in the beginning stages of forming a company that provides ABA (applied behavior analysis) services to children with autism. I am doing this with a colleague who initially we settled on splitting 50/50. This seems to be the easiest structure (in theory) and we figured that we would divide the work down the middle. (ie getting clients, getting them started, billing hours.).

We were not going to quit our other jobs until we had enough clients on each of our caseloads. (\~12 each). This would allow for the littlest drop in income when transitioning to our company. 

We agreed that we would each take 3 clients, run the company for a few months to get our feet wet, and then take on additional clients when certain metrics were met. (utilization of authorized hours & revenue)

It turns out, that my colleague is not going to be able to take more than 1 or two clients to start. I would imagine this changes the way equity is going to be distributed if I am going to be the one bringing in most of the billable hours. Granted, there are other areas that are not billable that I believe he will excel in, but it's hard to determine that before the company is up and running. For instance, he has access to high-quality therapists through teaching at a university, a better-established network of clinicians who could potentially work for us, and a higher degree. (he is a PhD vs me only having a MA).  Also, he will be the one that is training staff.

Im thinking a dynamic equity split but again, not sure how that would initially look and how it would change over time.",1

I'm a co-founder of a startup and COVID has been challenging to say the least. Lots of wins, lots of losses. Our runway is shrinking for sure, and it's probably time to throw in the towel. 

We have one competitor in the same space that sprang up around the time we did. They managed to raise more venture capital funding than we did, but we managed to gain seemingly more traction (more press, more deals in place, they don't run ads to acquire customers, their pricing is worse for a similar offering). 

Either way, we'll probably run out of money soon, but I want to propose a merger/acquisition to their founders. We certainly have things they would want, namely our customers and our deals-in-place. They could show investors they acquired a competitor, we could tell our investors we got acquired.

On the flip side, they might be *emotionally* opposed to the idea, because we've been a ruthless competitor for 2 years now. This means they're throwing all business logic out of the window, because that can happen.

They have no idea we might die soon.

People use the term ‘your lawyer’ or ‘my lawyer’? Are lawyers contracted? Is that a firm or lawyer you used before or have shortlisted? Like how does one get ‘their lawyer’? I’ve used a firm once for my Record Office. Are they the ones I call ‘my lawyers’? I’m a bit confused with how you guys contract and interact with lawyers. Also, is it better to keep approaching other firms for each task or should one stick with firm as much as possible?

I’m very uneducated on this aspect, so I’ll appreciate some guidance!

Edit: I’m talking of corporate lawyers and stuff. Not my personal life, even if I am equally unaware on that front.

Over the course of this year I’ve been validating and designing a new idea.

I’m at the stage now where I’m exploring the last of the costs - dev costs. 

I’ve been using fiverr for design work to keep the costs down, value for money it has been exceptional however overall the quality is only what I’d cal average. 

Has anyone had experience using fiverr to build an app? The cost is substantially lower than using a local uk agency but I don’t want to pay anything for something that is well below par. 

Any advice welcome, thanks in advance all.",1

To give you an idea my job is pretty comfy 9-3 job with two days off and an office, I don't do much anymore I barely have 1 hour of work a day, it seems like the job a lot of people would dream of from the outside, but actually the pay is shit, I get a minimum wage and I live in 3rd world country so you probably know how low is my salary.

I had the idea of starting my own business since I was in highschool, I did a little dropshipping before ebay decided to block every account I ever make, but I never had an actual business, I blame myself for that, I'm actually not bad at getting ideas for my business to grow even none of them had ever landed but my problem is that my motivation levels drop down drastically a few days after I start doing something, it happens all the time, it happened when I wanted to learn the harmonica, it happened when I decided to learn spanish, it happens two months after joining the gym, it's like I get a depressing episode that makes me feel tied up and unable to do what I have to do while the guilt is eating me.

Now I'm planning on finally quitting my job and start making a home improvement/tools shop sine there's a big subdivision is about to be built the next years, obviously I don't have enough capital so I'm gonna get a fat loan, but I'm scared that this doesn't work because of me, I've in the comfort zone for too long that I don't know if I'll be able to make this work, so I need your advices on what do you think I should do.

I'm sorry if you feel like this doesn't belong here, I just thought I'd find someone here who had the same struggle that can enlighten me.",1
Is my company a startup?,1,isvmhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/isvmhd/is_my_company_a_startup/,4,1600150945.0,"I'm currently in the process of starting a company for the first time and have been consuming lots of material online about how to build and run a startup. However, the more I think about my situation, the more I start to wonder if my company actually qualifies as a startup and if the startup advice I'm reading is actually applicable to me. Could you guys take a look at my situation and let me know what you think?

My product is a language learning app. The market for these types of apps is, obviously, already very well established, and my product is an evolutionary improvement over existing products rather than a revolutionary new approach. I plan on bootstrapping the company rather than attempting to get VC, and I'm not aiming to turn this company into a unicorn or to completely take over the market. Instead, I'm hoping to just find a modest niche in the market where my product can thrive. As of right now, the company consists of just me, and I don't see myself ever bringing on more than a cofounder and a handful of employees.

Is advice aimed at startups applicable to my situation or should I look elsewhere?",1

I hired a few people to write content and manage the page based on my franchise model (I wrote a huge document about all the processes used and am tuning it constantly).

It has been harder than I expected. Managing the income stream and tying it back to the network. Managing payouts. Managing the content schedule and growth. Keeping everything in track. Measuring performance of the model. On top of that, we are bootstrapped, and I can't be sure whether or not to invest money to start growing faster.

Is this a good pre-launch landing page conversion rate?,8,isswz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/isswz9/is_this_a_good_prelaunch_landing_page_conversion/,16,1600142898.0,"A month ago, I've had an app idea, basically an app that would be a competitor of existing platforms but would solve a common pain point.

Before I start coding, I've decided to first validate and test it. This is my first time testing an idea like this. 
So, I've made a couple mockups and built a landing page with:
- A mailing list subscription form that says that the app is coming soon and to leave email address to stay informed
- A separate feedback form that serves to validate the problem and dig deeper into issues linked to the existing platform. 

I've started ad campaigns on reddit and Facebook targeting the people around me. Basically 5 dollars a day on each platform for 2 weeks now.

Here are the numbers from these campaigns. The click through rate on Reddit was around 0.5%. This is computed against impressions which are in the 100s of thousands. Facebook was around 1% with one order of magnitude smaller impressions compared to Reddit.  

I'm using Google analytics and I found out that a big chunk of those clicks actually never make it to the landing page, closing their browser right after the ad click I'm guessing.

Out of those who finally make it to the landing page (about a 1000 people), the subscription to mailing list conversion rate (number of people visiting VS number of people who subscribed) sits at around 5.15%. The feedback form's conversion rate sits at about 2.6%.

On the page, I've also added some share buttons, and WhatsApp brought in about 49 visits with a subscription conversion rate of 9.63% and a feedback form conversion rate of 6%.

Just by looking at these numbers (without factoring in the form's results which are positive) and from your experience, what would be your initial thoughts? Is this something worth digging deeper in?",1

Here is the concept of the idea. I posted it on another site, and received a small about of positive feedback (so far 3 up-votes no down-votes, but no comments after 600 views). I have a skeleton of a solution for everything though I am certain there are improvements that others can make.

>The current most common practice of public engagement in governance happens after these documents are created. If we can move public engagement to before these documents are created we can both prevent corruption through policy manipulation, but we can increase engagement of the governance process to be more inclusive. A more inclusive society will be capable of greater achievements and prosperity, less inclined to disengage from governance and the forces of capitalism that drive wealth toward a more equal opportunity of outcome.

I can see a few monetization opportunities for this application beyond standard Social Media advertising. But I think the real money is in the application that I have an idea for that leverages the tools built here to improve government, in a way that could revolutionize product development. In addition the core tools developed for this can be leveraged heavily for other purposes.

I feel like the best way to do this is open source but I have no experience in starting an opensource project.

What I am really looking for right now is someone to partner up with me that has the business side down, has some experience or at least a belief in themselves that they can and a desire to try to recruit the right teams, and negotiate the deals to keep the project moving forward.

I am highly motivated and willing to learn and follow the lead of this person where we decide on a path forward.

So my ultimate question for you here right now is... How do I find that person? Or an alternate solution to a traditional startup path.",1
Should I do profit sharing?,94,isn1rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/isn1rg/should_i_do_profit_sharing/,26,1600126065.0,"Hi,

Sometime ago I made an app and I was helped by a very good designer.

Fast forward to today, I am working on another app and decided to contact her if she would be interested in making the UI/UX of this new app. She came back with the rate and an alternative solution - Instead of charging a rate, she would keep a percentage of the profits.

Now, I don't expect to get rich from this app - I seriously doubt I will ever get more from the app than from my day job but I'm wondering if profit sharing would be a good idea and if so, what would be an appropriate share. I would do all the dev work, support, server admin. While she would be in charge of the UI/UX and possibly, marketing, for as long as the app exists. This would include new designs for a future v2, v3, etc.

What do you think? Has anyone done this sort of agreement before?",1
Company VC funds and turning down money,2,isllkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/isllkm/company_vc_funds_and_turning_down_money/,6,1600121494.0,"I am lucky to be in a position where a bootstrapped B2B side project turned into a two-person startup... We've hit $25k MRR and are looking to make some new hires to help us scale, all while living in cash flow.  We've never really considered raising any capital, and don't need to at the moment.

However, we recently applied to a technology conference in our industry that is designed to bring together startups and companies, investors, etc.  We thought it would be good marketing and could help us get a few introductions.  It has gone swimmingly and we have had a lot of interest from both VCs and PE funds, but also from VC funds inside large companies in our industry.  So, two parts to this question.

1. We have taken the meetings with VCs because they requested them and we figure it is probably worth having the discussion because you never know what might come of them, and it seems like the more we said we didn't need money, the more they wanted to give it to us.  
**What is the best way to turn down money without burning bridges?  Is there ever a good reason to take money you don't need?** 
2. We have 6 meetings in the next 2 weeks with VC funds that live inside large companies.  This is a new concept to me - I assume that they are looking for both good investments and tech that is useful to their business.  **I would be willing to take an equity investment from these, but only if it delivers the parent company as a meaningful customer - Is this something that they normally do?**

And there potentially is a world where we could say let's go all-in and hire half a dozen devs and a big sales team, but given the affect Covid has had on my industry and its budgets I'm not sure now would be the time to do that anyway (i.e., I don't think our pace of development is holding us back).

Tech agency need to exit contract with problem client,6,iscdy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iscdy5/tech_agency_need_to_exit_contract_with_problem/,8,1600080116.0,"Hi all - wondering if you all can act as a sounding board for me on a contract issue with a customer.

I run a tech agency and have a client I want to terminate. There is a one month contract of which roughly half of the work was performed. The client paid 5k up front and delivery would result in a second and final payment of an additional 5k.

The reason for the desire to terminate is simply because I can see the client is becoming a real pain to work with, looking to wrangle the maximum amount of work out of the relationship even if it’s beyond the scope of the contract or within interpretation but clearly beyond the spirit of the contract, and finding ways to show how we are not doing the job well in an effort to manipulate us even though the work quality so far is absolutely great. classic dream client!

I would rather accept a loss and move on rather than spend what would likely turn into an additional 3-4 weeks of work listening to how we are not doing enough even though we are doing quite a bit more than the spirit of the contract already. I am aware of the legal side such as breach of contract.

My question is on the negotiation side of exiting immediately. I was thinking to state something like:

Option A: transfer of all assets immediately including extras like install documentation etc. both parties agree no further payment will be made.

Option B: return the $5k and I do not transfer the work.

I don’t see the individual being able to claim any damages as this is a startup with a first time build and they don’t have any business yet. Would not put it beyond this individual however to come up with something. Ideally would like to be stern but fair.

Long-time  lurker looking for some advice. I and 2 others run a boot-strapped B2B  SaaS startup that is bringing in moderate revenues after 2 years of  operation. Despite coronavirus disruption we have improved on our cash  position in the past 6 months, surviving relatively unscathed and  improving on where we were this time last year.

We  just however got told by a customer of ours that they are ending their  subscription, opting instead for a subscription with a tech giant whose  tech is far superior and more broad than ours, so as to allow them to  fulfill their requirement within a single platform as opposed to a  number of smaller, more tailored offerings (which included a  subscription with us).

This is our  first loss of a customer. Whilst it's not devastating, I guess it's a  big blow for me personally to lose a customer like this. It's stuck in  my head that we could lose more customers and then quickly find  ourselves in trouble. This is despite the fact that I know the majority  of our customers are very happy and not thinking of ending their  subscription or anything like that.

It's  causing me a lot of stress and so I just wanted to check in with people  here about their experience of losing their first customer. We are  growing well, currently looking to raise and building more exciting  tech, with a full scalable plan for the future, but it's hard to see  past the loss of the first customer - I understand that attrition will  always happen regardless, but it just hit a bit harder than I expected.

Throughout the months I helped organically build an audience for their marketplace, and we experienced a good amount of success. I have worked remotely the entire time, and was in school also. I put in a lot of effort, and helped actually build something which was cool, and inspiring. 

But over the recent few months my work has become less and less involved. When I first joined the startup I played a bigger role with planning, ideas etc. During this time I started building up other streams of income, (I had a lot of free time with covid, which helped). Also more recently, another person was brought on who kinda took the position/responsibilities I would have grown into. Now currently, this startup brings in 10% of my income, but like 20-25% of my time. And I’m still just an independent contractor.

Basically I am spending a lot of time at this startup every single day, I’m not staying because of the money, and I don’t see myself in a position to grow further in this company. How do I respectfully leave? I’ve never really quit a job before, I want to have references for this experience also though if possible, I don’t want to leave anyone in a bad position. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks",1
How to do a “customer journey map” when moving from concept to design ...

Angel investment exit advice,21,irg2q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/irg2q2/angel_investment_exit_advice/,19,1599958203.0,"Hello,

I made an angel investment that worked out great, despite putting in really no thought or effort. Since I was never particularly diligent about this investment in the first place, i need some advice!

**Background**

I was investor #1 for a small startup about 3 years ago, with a SAFE at valuation cap of $1M and an 80% discount rate. The company is now being acquired, so the liquidity event is at hand.

I invested partially because I wanted to make money and was confident in the founder, but I also had non-monetary incentive. As a startup founder myself, I wanted to sit on the other side of the table, ignorant as i was/am, so I my experience as an investor would be helpful when i started seeking investors myself. As it turns out, I had a good experience and made some money. 

**Question** 

I need help determining how to evaluate my decision to take my money and run, or roll over into the acquiring company. I know no one can tell me which choice is better except myself, so i am looking for help in how to evaluate this decision. 

TBH, i am pretty uninformed about all this stuff. I know i can read about it, and it is my personal responsibility to do so, but it still gets me confused. For example, [this quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-discount-and-cap-work-on-a-SAFE-note) is helpful. 

**Context**

I am tempted to roll over my assets into the new company, because they are about to raise a series B. As i understand, if i take my cash now, I get a 3.5x gross return (guaranteed). But given the discount rate, and the huge funding round the acquiring company seeks to execute, I might be able to see a 20x - 40x return (i think), given risk. 

**Deadlines**

I am meeting with the acquiring company's CFO next week, and want to prepare for it, so it's not a huge waste of time for both of us. 

**Addnl**

Question re. international founders agreements,2,ire7kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ire7kh/question_re_international_founders_agreements/,6,1599951998.0,"Hi there!

Long-time lurker, first time poster - nice to meet you all!

I'm a UK-based CRO of a fintech startup, with three other co-founders based in Amsterdam, NL and San Francisco, US. Our startup is incorporated in the Netherlands, and whilst we've been working on our product, we sidestepped all of the paperwork involved in share issuance etc by simply having the CEO own 100% of the shares (since we didn't want to spend money we didn't have at the time on handing out shares that were worth nothing before we were confident our product would 'take').

However, things have evolved now, and we're at the stage where we're due to start accepting investment funding. As such - since it's always easier to talk about money before it becomes real - we want to hammer out a founders agreement that dictates ownership for the sake of getting our cap table affairs in order.

*My question is* \- given that we're spread across three different countries, does a founders agreement have to be one that's legally valid in each founders' country of residence, or simply the country where the startup is incorporated? Does anyone here have any experience in such a setup?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",1

fire. Once again, the heavy smoke from all the fires burning along the
West Coast is blotting out the sun and casting everything in a hellish
red glow. Let me know if this resonates with you. How do you deal with
maintaining your sanity and growing your business while chaos rages all
around you?

I put links at the bottom of this post to the original blog and video,

Blog
----

I recorded the video for this episode in a hotel room while evacuated
from my home because of the Kincade fire in Northern California. A few
days earlier, when we were experiencing safety power outages and
watching the extreme fire conditions, I wondered if I should just skip
this episode. I was feeling very stressed and distracted. I thought it
might be interesting to do a short episode about how sometimes life
makes you look at where your true priorities lie. Then on Wednesday,
October 23, we saw the fire start on a ridge about 15 miles to our north
during another wind event. Between then and when we evacuated on
Saturday, I was not focused on anything but the fire.

However, once we were out of the area, and in a hotel with lots of time
on our hands, I had time to think more about this issue. I realized that
I really wanted to stay on track with these episodes, and that there was
not really any overpowering reason not to. Major adversity can certainly
justify all kinds of changes in priorities and plans; it is also easy to
use situations as an excuse. I could easily have just spent my time
hanging out in the hotel, refreshing the emergency information web
pages, and drinking.

Instead, I decided to go to a nearby store and pick up a cheap stand for
my phone, so I could record a quick and dirty episode. And doing it made
me feel better. I was doing something positive and productive when there
was nothing at all I could do about the main crisis going on.

If you are running a startup, you will likely encounter many existential
crises along the way. Hopefully, most existential to the business, not
to you or your family personally. This situation has reminded me of all
the times I experienced that as a founder. At the time, I was actively
studying kung-fu, and one of the lessons from that served me incredibly
well in business, and with this fire. They taught the concept ""mind like
water."" The idea is that, while water is incompressible, it freely
conforms to the shape of the container it is in. A mind like water stays
relaxed and adapts to situations as they happen. Stress and tension sap
you of energy without providing any benefit. They can actually slow down
your reactions and thinking. By staying relaxed, even in the face of
adversity, you can quickly pivot to take action on the most appropriate
task at any moment. Whether that be packing all your most valuable
possession in a car, or recording a podcast during downtime in a hotel.

As I get ready to post this, our neighborhood is still under mandatory
evacuation, but residents are being allowed back. Hopefully, things will
be largely back to normal soon, and the next installment will be more
typical.

Any suggestions for a Nonprofit Animal Advocacy Group?,2,iquzsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iquzsn/any_suggestions_for_a_nonprofit_animal_advocacy/,3,1599873839.0,"I have always been passionate about animals and since I have 2 dogs and a cat in my one bedroom apartment, I  can no longer foster or have animals overnight during transfers so I decided to start a nonprofit to help raise money for local rescues and shelters, but also connect animals in need to resources.

One of the co-founders is our project manager. Basically he runs the Jira and makes sure that the development team gets their stuff done. He has helped conduct user interviews as well as help make some decks.

The other co-founder has put in \~80k in funding of his own money. He has come up with a marketing plan, paid someone 5k to make us a pitch deck (that we had to edit a bunch because it wasn't perfect), found a marketing agency to make us marketing materials, and found a lawyer to manage the legal stuff.

I feel that the two non technical founders are not fulfilling their duties and here is why:

1. Project Manager position is nice to have but I feel the only contributions he makes is listening to what we have done that day. He doesn't actually do any work outside of being on meetings where we tell him what we did. If he does do work outside of those meetings its usually less than 10 hours a week.
2. The other cofounder says since he put in all the money he doesn't have to grind and put in all the time. He also says that he doesn't have to put in that many hours because marketing doesn't take a lot of time compared to writing code. He keeps boasting that he can get us meetings and get us funding but hasn't yet. Thats fine because we want to hold off on getting funding till we get users but I feel that it isn't a good excuse.
3. This is the first startup any of us has ever owned. We don't know how startups work. I have been watching YCombinator and learning about the importance of conducting user interviews, finding product market fit, etc. I have to ask them over and over to watch them and when I say we need to do user interviews they seem to not think they are necessary and almost a waste of time. It feels that they do them to shut me up.
4. We released our MVP but havent started marketing and its been a month because we are ""waiting for marketing materials"". I feel like they should be out there doing guerrlla marketing in the meantime or something.

Overall, it feels like I have to do everything and I just report into them. Am I correct in this statement? How do I communicate that they need to change in an effective yet polite manner.",1

So I found a cool name for my startup, got really lucky and managed to buy the .com (Yay!) directly.

But the thing is that this handle is taken on Instagram and Twitter. Not a big problem but I still want to make it right, so I was wondering if you guys have any advice on how to find a good handle when your brand name is taken.

What suffix or prefix should I use ? Can I just use ""\[brandname\]Com"" ? Is it a good idea ? Just need your input on that matter.

Its currently just me, no employees. Ive fulfilled two orders but bother were for friends/family, so not a ""real"" customer.
 I've had some interest this past week, but I'm having a hard time deciding what image to put forward on my website/emails in terms of company size.
 Since the product is wedding related, the social proof and the impression of trustworthiness is very important. Customers obviously don't want to take a risk renting something from a vendor that is cleary just getting started. No one wants to think they are the first order - its their wedding. So up until now, all my website copy reflects the image of a company that would appear to have a few employees and a good amount of orders under their belt.

But now that I'm having to respond to customer emails, I waffle between faking the image of a well established (or at least well funded) startup, or being mote honest about the fact that its literally me packaging items at 10pm in my basement.

For example:

Customer: Hi, can I purchase this product set instead of renting?
Honest answer: I currently only have one of that item in inventory, so you can only purchase it if you only need one (this reveals that I have literally no inventory).
Fake-it answer: Let me check with our inventory manager and get back to you.

Customer: Im having trouble booking product XXX.
Honest answer: I've updated the product listing and you should be all good now!
Fake-it answer: Thanks for the feedback! Our technical team is making updates.


Even something as simple as saying ""contact your customer care representative with any questions"" or ""send all media inquires to our marketing team"" seems like I'm lying. But it helps give the customer the impression that they can trust ""us"" to deliver their product on time for their big day.

What do you guys think? Where is the line between unethical faking, and fake-it-til-you-make-it?",1

Straight to the point, I'm want to launch my upcoming admin template product/startup (i.e. Bootstrap dashboard template) next week but I'm very much confused about the launch ideas. Is it works or not.

I've noted down all the required points & very much prepared about the launch plan along with marketing ideas but this is my first time ever I personally release my product with alone.

The basic Ideas I'm sharing here is

* List in multiple startups platforms like product hunt, angel list, etc...
* Use a freemium model where I upload the trial repository to GitHub, npm, etc...
* Create a landing page with an email subscription feature after that I'll target users through an email campaign.
* Showup my product launch & features through various social media like twitter, FB, dribble, etc...
* Blogpost about the launch & about the product on dev, hashcode, medium platforms.
* Product purchase gateway through gumroad.

Currently, I'm selling my products in different theme marketplaces but this time I take the risk to sell my template in my own way.

I'm very much experienced in Product Development but never gone through the marketing end. Currently, I've no email subscribers, social followers. All begin through scratch.

I need community feedback upon this scenario.

* What to do before pre-launch?
* What to take care of during the launch?
* How to build & stay close to the community?

As of now, I've invested a lot of time & more than $6K on project development.

They have cheaper prices advertised on their FB pages which will like encourage our highly price sensitive customers to continue ordering through the FB pages instead of our platform.

Need advice,3,iq1owp,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iq1owp/need_advice/,15,1599766907.0,"Hello, the Startup community!

As a part of a small startup team (6 souls at the moment) with a role that can be best described as just a Marketing guy, I sort of don't know where to apply my efforts now to bring most value.

A bit of background. Our product is an access control system. It's focused primarily on multi-family residential, which are plentiful in Eastern Europe - that's where we're from and where we will start sales from. Secondary focus is B2B - the system is versatile enough to serve corporate users too, but competition is a lot more severe, which is why this market is not the primary one.

Core value is supposed to be delivered via software - mobile applications instead of keys/keycards, management of the system via a web application without any locally installed old-school servers, etc.

The problem is this: Even in the best-case scenario, we will be able to start offering the product in 6 months from now - currently we're in the product testing and refinement stage. And investments in marketing aren't expected until that, meaning that for now, I have essentially no budget to work with - nothing but my own paid business hours.

I've made a website, created content for it, outlined the general marketing strategy, conducted all sorts of analyses, determined the marketing channels, audience, market needs, etc  - essentially, I know what to do when I have a product ready. But it's not. 

I've made everything I believe is reasonable at this moment - I simply cannot see what else would be useful to do in the marketing area right until we're ready to sell and we have a marketing budget to start doing that. And that's why I'm inclined to switch to helping the product development directly - testing, docs writing, etc (I 'm capable of doing that at a decently high level and the need is there  - the team is small and overloaded).

The question is: Should I switch to helping refine the product, or it's better to apply extra efforts to the marketing to sort of be more prepared when the time comes? And if so, what exactly would you recommend doing at this point?

Thank you.",1

How many shares to co-founder who helped develop the idea?,2,ipnqiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ipnqiv/how_many_shares_to_cofounder_who_helped_develop/,11,1599710039.0,"I'll try to keep it as short as I can, but the situation is as follows:

Two others and I have come up with a business idea, researched it, and really solidified the entire concept. The problem is that we're dealing with something that requires a lot of capital to even deliver a minimum viable product, so we need to find investors. Nonetheless, there's a ton of work that can be done before funding is even there. As such, two of us have decided not to seek for a full-time job (we just graduated) and put 100% in making this work. The third partner, however, has been working for a few years now, and he has made clear that he won't quit his job. That is the case for both pre-funding and post-funding, as we don't see the need for three people running the business in its initial form. This has led to a discussion (initiated by the two of us committing 100% now and later) as to how much the third party is really worth. He agrees that it's only fair that he receives less shares of the company when it is founded. Our problem right now is: How many shares does this person really earn?

Some extra considerations:
- The third person has definitely added value in the initial phase of developing the idea;
- A lot of work has been put in the pitch, for which the third person only provided comments;
- We have met for 2 hours a week (at best) to discuss the progress made on the pitch mostly;
- The two of us will be working full-time on the project until we receive funding (or until our personal deadline passes, as we can't be in this phase forever).

We're a bit in a pickle here, because we're friends, and we do see it as our creation. Nonetheless, we have trouble with having a future shareholder that does nothing and isn't even willing to fund the company according to whatever shares he has (albeit with a discount, so to speak). The advantage is that nothing has been agreed on contractually, so at the end of the day the two of us can do whatever we want. However, we want to do the right thing.

You might think that we have nothing to show for yet (i.e. no product), so that this is not a conversation worth having. But we're determined and are putting in our heart and soul. The last thing we want is to have these discussions when real money is on the table. We want things sorted (on paper) before it gets to that point.

Sorry for the long post, but I felt that I had to try the best I can to explain the important details.

I think we have a good manufacturer (China) and we have a good relationship (I think).  As we've begun to grow our sales, I'm getting a few emails back from customers letting me know that the stitching on this item is coming out and the side is tearing a bit.  Out of 86 of these products sold and shipped out - I've gotten 2 defective product emails.  I mean - I know this is like a 2% problem rate - but I get nervous (this being my first company) because our whole premise is high quality.

2) What is a normal defect rate I might expect?  I really don't know - should I be shooting for 100% good?  


3) Moving forward - as I get larger and order more product - what sort of agreements should I have in place with my manufacturer as far as quality control?  Assume I'm a complete rookie who is making every mistake in the book - but somehow pulling this business off?",1

*HELP!* Problem creating a Business Bank Account as a new 18 year old.,4,ip8de2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ip8de2/help_problem_creating_a_business_bank_account_as/,3,1599650497.0,"Hello All

In a bit of a situation here that’s been getting me really worked up. I recently just turned 18 a few days ago and filed for my first LLC, obtained EIN, submitted to IRS, etc, etc. I finalized my LLC but here comes the very frustrating part. When I was applied for a Business Bank Account, I input all my information and my SSN (Social Security Number) obviously. I wait a couple of days for it to be approved, but I got denied saying I “Mistyped” my SSN or couldn’t be found/identified. I know my SSN is 100% correct and even showed proof of my SSN Card to the Bank but it was still denied. I heard rumors that it could take up a few months for a new 18 year old to their identity (SSN) become fully identifiable, but I can’t really afford waiting a few months.

Is there anything I can do in my power to fix this? Any Recommendations? Help would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks.",1
A startup story from hell,22,ip6dty,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ip6dty/a_startup_story_from_hell/,26,1599642836.0,"Startup-life can be really, really crazy at times. The story below happened to me recently. What's your thoughts on this, what would you do?

It's a long read, but here is a TLDR;

*TLDR; Joined startup as co-founder, worked 6 months for equity only, fired for no cause, threatened with promises of violence if I didn't sign termination contract. Also had my reputation damaged when the CEO sent emails to my network stating I was a scammer and thief, in order to pressure me to sign the contract.*

**February**

I was contacted by the CEO of a software startup, and asked to join the company as a Project/Product Manager and co-founder. The company was at this time without technical employees, and the development process had been at a standstill for several months since a contract with an agency had expired. My task was to restart the development process by hiring new developers and managing the development team. I joined because the product was really nice. A beautiful app I definitely would use myself. I also liked the drive of the founder. He had a strong CV as well.

I joined the startup on an ""Independent Contractors Agreement"", where I was told this was to test how our collaboration would work out. If I would be fired or quit in this period, I would have a right to compensation according to the hourly fee stated in the contract and the hours worked.

**April**

I join the startup officially as a co-founder with 12.5% equity and sign the Founders Agreement. Another co-founder also joined at this time. 1 year cliff, 48 months vesting.

**June**

The 3rd co-founder is fired since he didn't have time to work without pay, and I am sent a contract where I agree to that the 3rd co-founder leaves the company. There is also a point in this contract where I agree to let go of any financial claims related to the ""Independent Contractors Agreement"". In retrospect, it seems very strange that this point was added in connection with the firing of the 3rd co-founder. But I was cool with it at that point because we had an oral agreement from when I joined in February, where we agreed to forget about the independent contractors agreement and rather shorten my vesting schedule with a few months. So, the vesting was also changed at this point, reduced by 3 months.

**A week later**

After 60+ rigourous interviews, I hire 2 developers I am thrilled to work with. I know the CEO would never be able to find these people himself, he doesn't have both the technical nor the social skills to do that. Recruiting is hard in the first place, and it is even harder to recruit senior developers for equity only during Covid-19. So this was a major achievement, in my opinion. Turns out this achievement was the beginning of the end for me.

We have planned to start a 2-week sprint starting in the afternoon. Beforehand, I have been asked by the CEO to list the planned tickets in a form with time estimates from the developers. I told him several times this didn't make much sense, but that I would do it. I asked the developers to give me an estimate and have it ready by the start of the workday (they live in 2 different continents, so they start working in the afternoon local time). The reason I think it didn't make much sense is that the developers couldn't possibly give time estimates this early. They just joined and are not familiar with the codebase. We need to have a thorough discussion about the tickets before we start the sprint. In any case, this shouldn't be the CEOs business, I am the one managing the developers. But he is extremely micromanaging and distrusting in general, so this was common behaviour.

Around 14:00 the CEO asks me why the form with the time estimates is not yet updated, and I reply that the developers have not responded to me yet, but that he is not to worry, as the workday hasn't started yet, and we in any case will have to discuss the tickets with the developers when the meeting starts at 16:00. The CEO does not agree with me, and fires me on the spot, by saying ""This is not working out, I will find another project manager"" 

I immediately understand I will be leaving this company no matter what, as we can't continue from here. He is obviously a complete douchebag, and is basically firing me without good cause. I am supposed to get a 30-day warning in these cases according to our contract. So I respond quickly, and tell him I am leaving, while also mentioning how I think his leadership style is severely lacking, and other things I feel is dysfunctional in the company. I am polite though, and end it with saying I am sorry it had to end this way. The only response I get back is ""thanks"".

Following this, all the other employees in the company (3 of them who I recently recruited, in addition to the CTO), contacts me and say they are very surprised about the news, and share their sympathies with me.

My access to all accounts (Slack, email, Jira, etc) is revoked within 30-60 minutes after my chat with the CEO. Slack was also where we had our last chat, so I didn't even have time to save our chatlog. If I hadn't been working remotely, I am sure I would have been escorted out by security guards. I felt very disrespected. It also felt like this was planned ahead. I did my job, solved a problem, worked for free for 6 months, and got kicked out right after I recruited a backend dev who got the same amount of equity as me. So in essence the guy I recruited will get my equity.

**Mid July**

I am sent an termination contract, where it is claimed that I am terminated due to bad performance, and that I am therefore a ""Bad leaver"", meaning I have no rights to equity or compensation. I did not sign the contract, as I knew this was a lie.

I respond to the sent contract, that I am going to have a lawyer look at at it and that it may take some time. I was strongly considering taking legal action, but was on the fence due to not knowing how good a case I had. Also was exhausted after spending 6 months of my time on this for nothing, and wanted to enjoy my summer holiday. So I let him wait, as I think it's my right to get some time to think about this.

**August**

The CEO contacts me a few times and asks about the status on the contract, I give the same reply, that he will have to wait.

We agree on him coming by my apartment to pick up a phone the company bought me. He never shows up, despite having made 2 appointments with him. I think he doesn't have the guts to face me.

**Late August**

I am contacted again and asked about the contract. This time I told him I can't sign the contract as it stands. I gave him the option to send me another contract where it says I quit. I decided it was not worth more trouble, I am just going to close this chapter and move on with my life. A lawsuit would be time consuming and expensive. By this time I am also well involved with another startup, both receiving equity and salary, so I don't want more distractions.

**KABOOM!**

**The CEO explodes in a raging fit and sends me threatening audio messages. I am told he and several others with ""Russian connections"" will come to my apartment to pick me up if I don't sign the contract, and ""anything can happen, who knows"". He even claims the angel investor is the one with Russian ties, and is the one I should fear. I can hardly believe my ears, this guy is batshit crazy. My wife got very upset by this, the rest of my family as well. (Note: I am in a Western European country)**

He also threatened to send emails to people in my professional network. Which he ended up doing shortly after:

**Later that day, I am contacted by people in my network, saying they have received messages from the CEO stating that I am not responding to emails and that they are looking for me - and that I have an iPhone that belongs to the company. I am, effectively, labeled as a thief and scammer.**

I seize communication with the CEO at this point, as it is getting way too weird for me. He's clearly out of control. He later sends me screenshots of some conversations with people in my professional network, where he is telling them I have this phone and is not responding.

I am then contacted by the (interim) CTO/tech advisor in the company who apologizes profusely for this behaviour, and asks how we can proceed from here to solve the problem. He offers to mediate. I accept and tell him I want an apology and retractment sent to everyone who has received messages about me, as well as documentation of this. I also again request a contract that states I quit of my own free will. Even though I am clearly quitting due to force and threats, I don't want to have anything to do with the company, it is mentally exhausting. I have to say though, the CTO is a nice guy, I have nothing against anyone in the company except the CEO.

**Last update:**

**September:**

**I still haven't received any documentation of the requested apologies and retractions sent to my professional network. I don't think it's going to happen due to his massive ego, therefore I have decided to file an injunction order against him, which will force him to send apologies/retractions to my network, as well as hindering him in sending further emails about me to people.**

I am also considering reporting him to the police for the threats, but not sure.",1

Today I discovered an app that was launched in Feb of this year that does pretty much what I was planning on doing, just a little more basic and a few less features than I had in mind. The app is something I’d probably try to use myself if I wasn’t trying to pursue my own. I felt crushed. Of course I thought of just scrapping it and moving into the next one, but this is what I want to do with my life and I genuinely care about it; wether I make money or not. I think I’ve convinced myself to keep going and just be better/different than them but it’s still bothering me.

I recently started a website that I envision as ""The Tripadvisor for Investment Fintechs"".

Basically a platform where users can find all investment platforms available in each country, filtered by category (online brokers, robo-advisors, crowdfunding, impact investing, etc), learn how these work and get unbiased reviews from both other investors and us (company).

The current online recommendations/comparison industry is saturated and has some conflicts of interest – there is an incentive to recommend the platforms that pay more.

This result is not so good platform recommendations for investors, and very little education, since platforms comparison and recommendations are what generates more money, leading to bad investments. 

I want to be 100% aligned with clients – investors -, so that I can help them achieve their main objective – make profit. 

Any ideas for other revenue models for a business like this that doesn't such a conflict of interest?

After a few months I saw it wasn't gonna work out (I wasn't getting paid because the company was barely making profits) so I slowly faded away and stopped working. The CEO was understanding. However we never officially ended our relationship (through email or something). Only some unofficial chats that hint we are no longer together. I signed a contract at the start of my work that said employment is at will. Re-reading now the contract is probably not enforceable given many clauses don't make much sense, I was naive back then and signed it regardless.


I'm planning to make a startup in the next months, and I want to be clear of any IP claims that the CEO may make in the future (highly unlikely but in case we get very successful, you never know), because I did them ""while employed"", (if the contract was never officially canceled I could theoretically be still employed even now right?). I'm also worried that potential investors might ask me all my previous signed contracts (to make sure the IP belongs solely to the company), but I have no official documents of the relationship ending, only the chats. So it might scare off potential investors.


I haven't talked to the CEO for quite some time. What evidence do I need in order to be clear that I'm out of this contract? Do I need to ask him for something? We have friendly relations but I wouldn't wanna go into much detail with him, just wanna get clear of the contract (which potentially is unenforceable, but I'm not a lawyer).

"Business is complex (basketball), not complicated (football)",17,iorac8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iorac8/business_is_complex_basketball_not_complicated/,1,1599590332.0,"Author and former director of the World Bank, Steve Denning, interviewed 2017’s world’s #1 management thinker, Roger Martin, about his new book: When More is Not Better.

LINK: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2020/08/18/overcoming-americas-obsession-with-economic-efficiency/#6cf4c80d2f2b

It’s a fascinating article, with two longtime mainstream management thinkers going back and forth about how the discipline has evolved from “maximizing shareholder value” (what Martin calls “the dumbest idea in the world” in his 2012 book: Fixing the Game) to managing holons of complex adaptive systems inside of complex adaptive systems.

In its simplest form, the craft of management is now being recognized by its leaders as having moved from football to basketball. From complicated to complex.

From Brave New Work, by Aaron Dignan:

“Contrary to popular opinion, among people who study systems theory, “complicated” and “complex” are distinct words with precise meanings. The engine inside a car is complicated. A complicated system is a causal system—meaning it is subject to cause and effect. Although it may have many parts, they will interact with one another in highly predictable ways. Problems with complicated systems have solutions. This means that, within reason, a complicated system can be fixed with a high degree of confidence. It can be controlled.

This is not to say that a complicated system can’t be confusing or inaccessible to the layperson. Quite the contrary. Understanding a complicated system, such as an engine or a 3-D printer, requires specialized expertise and experience. Here, experts can detect patterns and provide solutions based on established good practice. This is the domain of the mechanic, the watchmaker, the air traffic controller, the architect, and the engineer.

Traffic, on the other hand, is complex. A complex system is not causal, it’s dispositional. We can make informed guesses about what it is likely to do (its disposition), but we can’t be sure. We can make predictions about the weather, but we cannot control it. Unlike complicated problems, complex problems cannot be solved, only managed. They cannot be controlled, only nudged. This is the domain of the butterfly effect, where a small change can lead to something big, and a big change might barely make a dent. Here expertise can be a disadvantage if it becomes dogma or blinds us to the inherent uncertainty present in our situation.”

About time.

Business has never been complicated, despite decades of management theory trying to make it so. This book is important because once HBR talks about it, Fortune 500 businesses listen. The mainstream is recognizing what the edge has used as their competitive advantage for years: that business is complex, and the best way to manage that is highly engaged, empowered, and aligned people.",1

Why haven't you migrated to value-based pricing (service startups),0,iohck5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iohck5/why_havent_you_migrated_to_valuebased_pricing/,6,1599545515.0,"I have studied, learned, and slowly applied the concept of value-based pricing. 

With it, you set prices based on the **perceived or estimated value of a product or service.** This means that the cost of the product or market trend doesn't play a role when pricing.

It's interesting when applied. Wonderful when you charge through it.

Airplane tickets are a great example of this. Date, seat, and season affect the price even though you are going from A to B.

The interesting thing is that I don't see many service businesses using this pricing model.

It can be a local business or Walmart and they still charge by the hour.

**What's your pricing model and why?**",1

Validation Doldrums - when to get the oars out and push forward?,1,iog3w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iog3w8/validation_doldrums_when_to_get_the_oars_out_and/,0,1599541497.0,"I’m currently working through the validation phase for a hardware product. I’m trying to find the balance between an appropriate amount of data with which to determine the idea is ‘validated’ and moving quickly enough to maintain our momentum and edge. 

From what I’ve gathered, there will never be a time where we feel ‘comfortable’ moving forward; there’s always risk in a startup. I find this to be especially true in creating a hardware product, as there is far more required in terms of resources up-front than a software product. 

What I’m wondering is, what have you all used to determine when you should move forward? Gut? Data (how much)? Customers willing to buy (how many)? 

So far we have been using renderings to market through Facebook/Instagram, as well as conducting customer interviews and surveys (trying to extend beyond the friends and family circle). There is definitely interest and a market, although to what degree I’m not sure we could figure out without putting more funds into expanding our operation ($$$). I feel that we could of course validate further, but am most concerned with losing that momentum. 

Should we keep validation to just enough to check the box and move forward, assuming a level of risk on the funds we invest (bootstrapping at this point)? Or is that irresponsible? I believe we can make it happen, and am fine assuming risk, but I want to make sure we approach this methodically, not haphazardly.

Thanks for any advice!",1
"You don’t need a big product launch, it will most likely lead to failure anyway (crosspost from /r/entrepreneur)",1,iodhum,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iodhum/you_dont_need_a_big_product_launch_it_will_most/,23,1599533552.0," Why does a big product launch almost always mean a failed product in tech, think products like:

* **Airtime** (Spent millions in marketing)  competing with Chat Roulette and lost)
* **Google Glass** (Sergey Brin parachuting into Moscone Center)
* **Quibi** (Currently spending millions, but looks like they will fail)

Then we have the biggest tech products and they never had a launch:

* **Google**
* **Facebook**
* **Instagram**
* **Snapchat**
* **The company that I founded and now has 46 million users** (can't say the name as it breaks the rules here)

Here is why you should **never invest in a big launch**. If the product is bad it is a waste of money, if the product is great they will find the product anyway.

Great products release early, listen to their users, and improve. You can’t do that if you do a big launch. A big launch means a finished product. A tech product is never “finished” on the first launch.

Selling a company/SaaS with 1 customer?,2,iodeqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iodeqr/selling_a_companysaas_with_1_customer/,9,1599533290.0,"Hi all, 

I have spent the past two years developing my company, a live streaming youth sports company. I have spent over $60,000 developing the site (hired developers). Our company/product is 100% scalable, able to handle literally thousands of live streams and millions of viewers at once. We offer a unique business model, one that can work well given economy of scale. Ads, PPV, and digital downloads. We have partnered and integrations with major companies in our space, we have an email list of over 10,000 emails, Facebook and Twitter accounts. We have an iOS app. Our site is built on AWS, and has live streaming for pennies a minute. 

Problem is, I've learned I am a builder (an excellent project manager), not a marketer/CEO. We have 1 active customer (given we're in IL and IL has banned sports for the fall). However, we have over 250 events broadcasted on our site, and have had a few customers in the past.

I am looking to sell the company or do something with it, to at least make some of my money back on it. COVID has been rough, and need the cash and don't have the time to ""wait for it to take off"". I've posted it to flippa, have a few watchers, but no bites. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",1
Automating annoying stuff in your life with integrations,6,ioddqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ioddqb/automating_annoying_stuff_in_your_life_with/,3,1599533200.0,"No app does it all - but luckily for us non-tech people, you can tie apps together and end up with truly useful automations. The four platforms I've been able to find that help tie stuff together are:

- Zapier (the most common one)
- Integromat (very similar to Zapier but a bit more visual)
- Parabola (specifically useful for moving data)
- IFTTT (mostly for hardware, like Amazon Alexa, Ring, etc.)

I didn't really test IFTTT (Which stands for If This Then That) - as I don't own much smart home stuff, but it seems like they have a series of pre-built recipes to tie your smart home hardware together.

But the two main ones are Zapier and Integromat. These things are crazy.

As an example, let's say I run a blog, and I use Webflow/WordPress to host it.

Let's say I often don't have access to my laptop, but the submission process for my blog articles on Webflow/WordPress only works on desktop. With a tool like Zapier, I could connect something more mobile-friendly like Google Forms to my Webflow/WordPress site, and actually write and submit my blog articles from Google Forms.

Then, let's say I have a newsletter on Mailchimp that I use to notify my audience when I post a new blog article. Usually, I fill in a template and copy-paste the summary info from the blog article into the email, and schedule it for the upcoming Monday. However, with that same Google Form, I could have a series of inputs that cover all the information needed in the newsletter, then send it out directly after I submit the form.

My whole blog/newsletter process has now been compressed into one single form that I don't even need my laptop to use.

That's a super basic example, but it shows how powerful these tools can be. I eventually want to get to the point where I can create fully functional products out of a subset of smaller apps.

Another common use case is connected databases to front ends. So, for instance, if I had a google sheet with data I wanted to display on my website, I could do that through Zapier. Connect Google Sheet data to Webflow or Wix collection items, and it's done. The updates won't be completely live, but they'll be close.

I would love to hear more use cases for this - obviously, mine are relatively simple - any ideas? Any stories you've heard?

Also, I wrote this based on a live stream I did, where we messed around with all the above tools - let me know if you wanna see the highlights. :)",1

Feeling defeated - my startup has a similar sounding name that a multimillion dollar company has in my space - they reached out and told me I have to hand over my domain otherwise theyll take legal action,274,io0202,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/io0202/feeling_defeated_my_startup_has_a_similar/,196,1599478208.0,"Hey guys,

I’m the owner of a resume critique startup . The idea was to create an AI-driven resume critiquor so people can get their resumes reviewed in seconds.

It only made $30 since launch, so I ended up just making the service free. Especially with COVID, I thought it’d help people out that need to get jobs so I put it as a free service, eating up the server costs. 

Two days ago (3 yrs post launch), a company in my space, whose name is COMPLETELY different (they rebranded years ago), message me on LinkedIn, telling me that they have a trademark on the name “The (companyname)”, (mine is companyname, so comanyname.io) and hence if I dont take it down, they’ll take legal action against me and file a UDRP. 

I single-handedly launched this startup in 2017, doing everything from the name, to the branding, to the middleware, to the backend engine that drives the startup. I made $30, and this company that’s supposedly a multimillion dollar company is telling me to take it down. 

I’m not sure if there is any point of me posting this, except I’m just sad. This is my baby, I put so much into it. And even though it doesnt make shit, I still proudly tell people to go to resumator.io. Yet there’s nothing I can do, except vent. I just feel really, really sad.

And honestly, it’s just pathetic. For a company making millions to go after me and threathen me with legal action, even telling me I must take it down by Tuesday. They rebranded years ago AWAY from that name and have a completely diff name. First the CMO came after me, then the CEO. Pathetic. 

It’s a cruel world man.

Edit: wow!!! Thank you guys so much for the support. So I’ve decided that I wont fight, it’s just not worth it. I’ll rebrand and relaunch soon :)",1

Negotiating offer to jump ship for a competing startup,6,inv2bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/inv2bd/negotiating_offer_to_jump_ship_for_a_competing/,3,1599458897.0,"I currently lead operations (customer success, support and renewals) for a small enterprise software company. My current employer has 25 FTEs and generates $7 million in annual revenue. I report directly to the CEO, who is the sole decision-maker as this is a bootstrapped company. 

My current boss is a micromanager and has made some ethically questionable decisions, so when a larger competitor reached out, I was curious what they had to offer. For context, the competitor is VC funded and has approximately 150 employees and $25 million in ARR. I quickly learned that I am underpaid and overworked for this niche market, as the employee to revenue ratio indicates. 

Next week I’ll be receiving an offer from the competitor. This will only be for an individual contributor role (think: technical solution manager) but offers a higher base salary and better benefits. The challenge is I believe the competitor is likely to lowball me (relative the position’s range), despite moving quickly on my candidacy and having very positive feedback throughout. 

During this process, I’ve been discussing two different roles at the same level with one offering higher total compensation due to commissions. They’re now trying to say that they want all new hires to start in the lower paid role. I’m not thrilled about this, and the recruiter threw out some salary numbers at the lower end of the range ($125-135k). As I have experience in this specific niche and would be taking a cut in seniority to work for them, I believe I should be an exception to start in the higher paid role and receive the higher end of the salary range ($150k+). 

I am very likely to receive a counteroffer from my current boss, as my role is business critical and we’re understaffed as it is. In terms of the comparison between the competitor and my current employer:

*Overall compensation: Likely competitor as my current compensation is ~ 25% bonus, which is variable from quarter to quarter and heavily taxed  
*Benefits: Competitor 
*Title: Current Employer
*Influence: Current Employer
*Market share: Competitor 
*Leadership: Competitor
*Team: Likely current employer because I’m the hiring manager
*Equity: Not a significant factor 
*Location: Not significant 
*Travel requirements: Similar
*Workload: Position with the competitor would be significantly less work
*Signing bonus: Unlikely

How should I approach this? My current employer is less than ideal, but I already have a better title and more influence than I would have at the competitor. I would also need both a promotion (think: VP of Operations) and raise to stay but have a good chance of getting both. (I received a promotion and raise early this year, but both were underwhelming.)  

I know I need to ask for a few days to think about the offer and then come back with a counter. How should I approach this with my current employer? If the initial offer is decent, I’m thinking I skip straight to submitting my resignation to get a strong counter while I’m still negotiating the competitor’s offer. (My boss tends to only offer significant incentives when forced.) Thoughts? 

Notes: I’m borderline FIRE (financially independent/retire early) but would like to work another 10+ years in tech before pursuing lower paying work that I enjoy more. While I have options aside from these two employers, finding a comparable position outside of this niche would be more difficult. 

TL/DR: Receiving an offer from a stronger competitor in the market and will need to negotiate. Also hoping to get a counter from my current employer. Need to get the last, best and final from both quickly in order to make a decision.",1

What would be the number of E-mail opt-ins to say that my idea is validated?,3,inpjtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/inpjtq/what_would_be_the_number_of_email_optins_to_say/,14,1599440389.0,"I'm trying to validate an idea without building the actual product. The service itself is supposed to be a niche content platform with some social features. I have a landing page where people would leave their E-mail if they are interested.

So, what would be the number of opt-ins indicating that the idea is worth the effort? I think that the only realistic monitizing strategy for such kind of service is ads and that would mean that I need a good number of users to make it viable, especially considering that infrastructure costs will be on the higher side because of the content storage aspect.

If the idea is good enough, I will be building MVP myself and let's say I can make it in half a year in my spare time.

I need some indicators because I already have a project going on in completely different area with completely different tech stack where I'm in the process of building the MVP. The other project is impossible to validate the same way because it is all about the implementation and just listing the features says nothing. For the argument sake let's say this is a mobile game (not quite, but close enough to give an idea why it is so hard to compare).

I feel like both ideas have great potential and both solve problems I have. Given decent implementation, I would love to be an active user of the first one and pay for the other.

Your social life is as important as your startup,227,inlftt,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/inlftt/your_social_life_is_as_important_as_your_startup/,43,1599425280.0,"I wanted to share some realizations I had recently with the hope that it can help somebody else who's just starting a business or to find people who might be sharing the same.

I've been in the startup ecosystem for almost 2 years, in an industry that is currently growing (in other words - it's a hell to sell). For these 2 years, I learned A LOT. Maybe because I didn't have any previous experience and needed to learn everything the hard way, or maybe because I was too naive...

### The biggest lie
We all ""know"" that in order to succeed we need to work 14+ hours a day, 7 days a week, for months and months. After all, it's the hard work that makes the difference, right? ""Work now, party later"", ""Work like hell"" - And all the startup gurus are saying the same thing. Even more, our local startup community and friends are doing the same. You see FB & Instagram stories ""Hustle at 2 am"", then another story from the gym at 6 am. It must be the truth, but why we're not feeling happy, or good. After all, we're leaving the dream!

The truth is - it's all a fucking lie. In fact, it's the exact opposite. Let me explain why.

### The truth
No one can deny that having a startup can be a fucking hell. Constant depression, stress, and anxiety can drive you crazy (especially if it's your first time). Somedays you just want to hide somewhere and forget about everything. 

It's even harder if you do that all alone - no cofounders, no friends (most don't really care about you if they don't need a favor), no girlfriend (or boyfriend), not working out or having time for yourself. It's slowly killing you from inside out. I've been there.

You might not be realizing it at first, but at a certain point, all of this is starting to reflect on your business as well.

### Your social life is as important as your startup

Your social life, friendships, nights out, working out, sexual life (having a girlfriend/boyfriend), time for yourself is as important as your startup (if not even more). I can't stress how crucial is that for your well-being.

It's not about working hard, it's about working smart. It's about working 9/5 for yourself! And don't get me wrong there is a huge difference between **working 9/5 for someone else** & **working 9/5 for yourself**. 

Working 8h a day, 5 days a week will actually help you stay focused on the work. It will help you find ways to be more productive and work smarter than harder. Having free time (for your social life) will actually help you recharge your batteries. You'll be happier which will reflect tremendously on your startup.

The gold environment is where there is a balance between the two. After all, we are humans - we need to socialize, to feel loved, to take care of our well-being. It's a long game and at a certain point in your business journey, you'll realize it. Why it can't be from the beginning?",1

A startup full of unpaid interns? Is it normal?,45,ink1cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ink1cv/a_startup_full_of_unpaid_interns_is_it_normal/,52,1599418095.0,"Hi, so I have a dilemma what to do. 

A week ago I started a 100% remote internship at a startup. It's supposed to last 6 months. It's registered as an LTD in the UK and I'm also based in the UK.

My role is a graphic designer. I'm still a student and I already had two unpaid internships in startups abroad (with only paid accommodation costs - these weren't remote internships) before this one.

Now when I joined the team I learned that most of the employees are unpaid interns too. There are like between 11-20 people in the team. We all work remote across various countries on 4 different continents. I think the only paid people are the experienced devs and the founder and his friend. The whole UI/UX design team are two MA students who are unpaid interns too. The marketing team consists of 3 UK-based students (again unpaid) and one Indian guy who is like the marketing executive/manager, but from his LinkedIn profile and his posts there it seems like he's unpaid too (he referred to it as an internship so that's why I think so).

The branding of this company isn't great. Frankly, it's not really developed yet. Like, their website and logo looks good, but there is no set style for the social media graphics. This week I was expected to produce some graphics for social media which I did, but I heard from one of the other designers that the boss doesn't like some of it, that ""it doesn't fit the brand"". The problem is, there are no other social media posts (they just started) to rely on for the guidelines in terms of style. There is no designer employed to develop the brand visual identity, the UX/UI people focus more on the app itself and the marketing people are just a bunch of unpaid students with no background in branding either. I could develop the brand style myself, I think it'd be good for my portfolio. However, it would take time especially with me working here only 10 hours a week and the boss is very pushy with timing and says we need to start posting social media content asap.

I also feel like this internship may interrupt my studies. Now I don't have uni yet, but it starts next week. I agreed to do this internship for approx. 10 hours a week. However, I get messages like everyday through the past week, I think I spent like 2-3 hours just on the calls/virtual meetings alone. And then in just 7 hours I'm expected to prepare all the other files for all social media channels. It makes me anxious because I feel the time pressure and I don't really want to work more than the agreed 10 hours as it will result in me having less time for my uni and college (I'm taking two courses this year). After I raised some concerns regarding lack of branding direction during the all team meeting (I mentioned I've already worked over 10 hours this week - which is true - I said it bc I felt the need to justify why I didn't manage to do some other stuff (illustrations for the app) they wanted me to do), the boss called me privately and said ""doesn't it says 10 to 20 hours in your contract?"" It's a bit of a red flag for me, felt like he tried to pressure me to put in more work hours during the week, even though the contract states ""approx. 10 hours"" and this guy himself said during the interview that ""it's 10 hours, it's like a one full-time work day a week"".

So my questions are: what do you think about situations like this? Should I leave this start up or do you think this experience is still worth it? Is it exploitive behaviour from the founder's side? Or am I overreacting? I don't mind working or doing some projects for free in order to improve my portfolio, I've done it in the past. But at the same time I don't like being taken advantage of and that's how I feel right now given that there are no senior graphic designers (or you know just normal paid designers employees) or even marketing & PR people to mentor me properly in my field. In the previous startups I've been in the ratio of interns to employees was much more healthy like 2-3 interns to approx 12 paid employees.

TL;DR: The vast majority of the people in the startup are unpaid interns, including me. I'm a graphic design intern, but there is no senior/normal paid graphic designer to provide me with mentoring. The boss tries to push me to work more than agreed 10 hours a week and I'm scared it will affect negatively my studies as I take two courses this year.",1
Compensation for CPO role in Series A startup,2,inhppq,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/inhppq/compensation_for_cpo_role_in_series_a_startup/,9,1599405026.0,"I'm being recruited for a Chief Product Officer role at a startup that did their Series A about one year ago. 

I'm confused by the compensation package.

* Instead of straight equity, they are offering me stock options. 
* The options are set at2x the strike price after Series B, which the company hasn't done yet.
* They've offered 0.5% ownership if I calculate it. 

This seems low? Or are my expectations too optimistic?

I'm excited about the product and the role would be a fun challenge for me, but right now it just feels like I'd be leaving a cushy job in a post-IPO unicorn, with a lot of unvested equity still on the table, for something that... doesn't even have the promise of big money.

How to Sell to the Enterprise: Avoid Saying No,175,in7vdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/in7vdb/how_to_sell_to_the_enterprise_avoid_saying_no/,23,1599364979.0,"One of the hardest parts of building an enterprise SaaS company is figuring out how to crack large accounts – $100k-$10m annual contracts. I've been thinking and writing on this topic recently, and wanted to share some of those thoughts below ([original post here](https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/09/01/enterprise-selling-dont-say-no.html)):

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.

Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.

The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “[Selling Sunset](https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/),” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).

Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, [moving to the cloud](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/) – can be [exponentially more complex](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/). The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.

## Detractors Want You to Say “No”

Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.

Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:

* Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.
* Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.
* Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.
* People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.
* Competitors.
* (Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.

One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is **time**. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.

In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data *just right* for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.

Ways to say Yes more:

1. Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.
2. Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.
3. Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.
4. Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.
5. Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales & marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.

Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.

## Case Study: Salesforce

Salesforce has a *decent* product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.

If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:

* They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.
* They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.
* They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).
* Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.
* Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.

## Case Study: Slack

Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:

* They have a web of Slash /commands, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.
* They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.
* They once made it dead simple [to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat](https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack) (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). [They still provide this for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams).
* Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.
* As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.

## Takeaways

Saying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:

* Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.
* Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.
* Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.
* Build no-regrets enterprise features.
* Sell to the right customers.",1

Mine was ""no,"" because I got weird signals about this guy's attitude. For example, at some point I shared a screenshot of the homepage of his current company, which isn't great. He said ""thank God marketing isn't my responsibility."" That seems like the wrong attitude to have as a designer of a company that's only 40 people (and much smaller when he joined).

For example: First I need to have a lot of money, so that then I can spend more time painting, and finally become an artist.

I’ve used this pattern in my own life plenty of times, each time reliably staying stuck in neutral despite my grand visions. First I need to hit this quarterly revenue number, then I can focus on building a customer centric business and finally doing some good for the industry. First I need to close this financing, then I can focus on making our employees happy and being the kind of leader I know I can be.

This logical process is natural. It is also toxic, in that it places an impossibility (having something you don’t) as a condition for progress, thereby justifying indefinite procrastination.

Life, and business, at its most dynamic and most successful, works the exact opposite: Be => Do => Have.

First I will recognize that I am an artist. Right now, this moment. Then as an artist I will paint. Right now. And then, eventually, I’ll become successful and make a lot of money.

First I will be the best kind of leader I can be. From that place I will make the decisions that are in keeping with my best form of leadership, and the quarterly revenue numbers and closed financing rounds will follow.

“Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then, do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.” — MARGARET YOUNG

If you find yourself stuck in an area of your life, or your business stalled on an important project, look for the way you talk about progress. Simply focusing your efforts on what you can control—who you are and what you do—is the fastest way to get unstuck.

And if you find yourself running a startup to make a lot of money, so that someday, eventually, you can focus on using business to help people and be the human that the world needs you to be (not that I know anything about that), well, it works there, too.",1
I Left My Job to Build a B2B Online Marketplace. What to Focus on and What to Delegate?,5,imcc49,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/imcc49/i_left_my_job_to_build_a_b2b_online_marketplace/,27,1599237294.0,"Hi all,

I need your advice in identifying the most important thing or two of my business to focus all my energy in tackling as I start. There are so many aspects like technical, sales, marketing, accounting, recruitment, legal work, etc.

  
1- What tasks I must do myself, as a founder/owner, and shouldn't depend on others to do them?

2- What tasks I should hire others to do?

3- What tasks I can outsource, at least in the first year or two?

My current plan:

Year 1: Build the MVP myself initially to test the market, which I think I can do, then get a technical partner onboard in the second half of the year. We would be co-building the product together until product/market fit (hopefully!).

Year 2: I will be basically doing all other things on my own (e.g. marketing, selling, etc).

Year 3: Recruit and delegate!Year 

4: Focus and refine the product.

Year 5: Growth.

The main reason for posting this is I don't want to spread myself thin and waste my time and energy in the minor stuff. Please enlighten me!

Thank you!",1

How would you guys advise to determine the cost per acquisition of new customers?

I had an idea for a software startup and before starting to code, I wanted to know if anyone would use my product. Therefore I created a smokescreen website explaining what the app would do and added a call to action button which would get you signed up. Once you click on the CTA button you will be forwarded to a page saying that the app is currently being built and that you can subscribe to a newsletter to get 3 months of premium for free once the app is out.

Here are the stats:

* duration of the ad campaing: 4 days (I know, rather short)
* unique users: 36 (according to google analytics)
* clicks on the call to action: 30 = 83.33%
* newsletter sign ups: only 1 = 2.77%

I don't exactly know how to interpret this data. 83.33% of users are willing to sign up (which is great), but only 2.77% are willing to subscribe to the newsletter / mailing list. I am not sure which of these 2 metrics is more significant or rather reflects the willingness of users to get the app.

"Developed two products, one during quarantine... have two MVPs and one production ready product, but my partner and I need to hire two people with consumer product experience to take the reigns. Where would you start?",2,im09gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/im09gs/developed_two_products_one_during_quarantine_have/,8,1599189977.0,"tl;dr - Capable and self funded IoT startup, that's a part of a very well funded accelerator, needs help finding someone to fill in the gaps and take the reigns and help launch our product. Looking for a CEO/President/co-founder.

So just like the title says. 

I'm a serial entrepreneur. I have been involved with about a dozen 'startups' in one way shape or form. I've had two decent exits  that helped fund some of the current things in my pipeline. 

The first product that I'm looking for help with, is a consumer product that ages red wine in under 20 minutes... we had to sideline it due to funding; This product is at the launch line and could goto market immediately, everything is done. Have an entire design package (STEP files, GERBER files, mold drawings for manufacturing, quotes for manufacturing, the works). We got into one of the nations largest accelerators because of this product, but since it's the only product they've ever featured, we got little help unfortunately. 

Due to my biz partner getting robbed and shot four times in the back using Offerup and those users being anonymous and Offerup hiding behind two huge law firms... we had an idea for an app. We started (and finished) development of an Instagram 'feel' P2P eCommerce rental platform that lets you list or rent just about anything you can think of. Partnered with two delivery companies, locker systems, ID verification companies, insurance providers, the works. Was raising funds in The Bay when COVID shut everything down, so we are sitting on that until things loosen up (it'll be on the app store in stealth mode next week or two).  This app ALSO got into an accelerator (still is). Unfortunately, again, due to COVID, it's on hold. 

While talking to a Partner at a very large and well known VC firm beginning of May, he was discussing a problem he had while on lockdown (a problem not exclusive to lockdown but only exacerbated because of it). He was bitching on the Zoom call about what happened and that if someone could solve the issue, its something A.H. would definitely invest in.

So we put our thinking caps on and solved it. 

Incorporated end of May, finished our very usable prototype and the backend part that communicates with it (it's an IoT device).  I can't get into this one on here quite yet (we have a non-provisional patent filed already and would discuss it privately), but lets just say it addresses quite a few problems in one solution and the randomized/anonymous surveys that we've had done, all point to a sizable TAM (Single Family Home Owners, $100k a year income, one kid under 18, frequently uses IoT devices, Frequently uses delivery providers). 

We got into a third accelerator, this one funded by a very famous Billionaire. We get a TON of support here. They have a TON of resources, but the one thing that isn't growing on trees... are C-level or should I saw, C-capable executives that are hungry, know what they're doing and believe in our products... 

...which is why I'm here. 

We have a seasoned team supporting both products. Have access to two really popular accelerators. We have engineers, software developers, marketing professionals, Sommeliers, anything we need to be successful... except someone to take control and steer this ship. 

You're in my shoes... where do you start. Obviously we are looking through our accelerators, but Reddit is a lot larger than they are and I actually met my biz partner on here locally about two years ago... so why not?",1

This is my first post here and I've been reading threads for a few days now and they have been invaluable.

My first startup just failed. Luckily, I'm only a few hundred dollars down, and I made so many bad choices that the knowledge gained has been more than worth it. I'm not defeated at all, just more resolved, and feel unstoppable (a bit of a weird thing to say after a failure).

I've been collecting information from this sub and decided that before I even think about my audience and a product to do some in depth research. I know that sounds like a no-brainer but bear in mind I'm new to this. I'm a dancer creating a dance-based product, so I know my product well but the rest is a learning process. 

I did some research the first time around, and everything looked good so I jumped in to design and create. So many mistakes that I may go into in a different thread, but the bottom line was nobody (well, except for 12 people) was willing to pay for the product. So back to the drawing board. 

Someone on another thread said that one of the most valuable things you can do is to talk in depth to even just one person. My question is, how to structure this conversation. I guess it's best to keep it as open-ended as possible, but how about asking them beforehand to consider certain questions so they come into the conversation having given it some thought?

Any advice or insight into this would be very helpful. I don't want to waste the opportunity. I'm planning to talk to around 10 people in depth in order to decide what product to develop (within my area).

I don't want to delve into details too much, but pretty much this is a summary of the situation: We created a mobile app that handles interaction with certain hardware, this type of hardware is being used by specific companies (and as its being produced by a large company more companies will start use it) 

The app handles payment transactions,  user management, analytical data of users, ability to market to users, etc. 

Right now we are scheduling meetings left and right with companies who might want to start using this, but I am unsure how we can make money from this the right way. The options we see are: 

\- Cut of transaction

\- Licensing (ie charge per machines connected to the app)

\- White labeling of the app 

\- Sell access to data 

\- Sell marketing space in-app 

\- Some form of a combination of above 

The market is somewhat small now, but we believe it's going to grow quite drastically and our solution has the potential to grow with it, so a potential low price would make sense to catch the market.

Seed Funding or Soft-Loan?,8,ilpi2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ilpi2r/seed_funding_or_softloan/,4,1599149914.0,"Hi,  
I bootstrapped a startup.  
Within the first month we got 15 customers, 75% of whom we believe will stay with the platform. 5 of whom have ordered twice. We did zero marketing, our customers all came through our various partners on the platform.

I developed the entire platform - app, server, website, data collection/cleaning.  
I have one partner who does marketing, and another new one that does sales (he gets more partners onto the platform/makes the presentations/enters us into competitions). The two of them have been building up for a marketing barrage; but we are waiting until certain new features/integrations are added/occur before marketing. Neither of these guys nor myself get salary.

Now the thing is, I started with around $5000 in my pocket. I'm down to my last $1200. I live in India - so this money lasts much longer. I have salaries worth $300 every month to pay. I'm guessing the marketing barrage will take at least $400. Living expenses are rarely above $250. But essentially, I'm down to the last 2 months of what my little bit of saved capital got me. It will take certain scale, like 10 orders a day to justify the salaries we are paying. If we reach that point, I don't have to worry about salaries anymore - if we reach 20 orders a day. I don't have to worry about my living expenses. Then it is just scale/market - scale/market.

I have a soft-loan offer from friends and family for $20,000.  
I am trying to win this Government of India competition that will give me $5000-$10000 along with a bunch of other resources I don't really care about. I believe I have a good shot of winning this competition; I've won competitions like this before with far less to show.

Should I try and go for seed funding?  
My business has enormous potential, I know several Millionares/two Billionares; some of whom have already expressed interest in funding. I could spend the next month setting up meetings and getting funds. But it'll take so much time, and I'm already busy with all this code.

I had a successful demo launch with a little piece of shit app i put together, but it got really good feedback locally (physically) and in my local subreddits. But now I have a lot of clients that want a complete app - asap. 

So I need to accelerate my MVP development. I'm going to invest some cash and divest myself from leading development (I have two junior devs working for me now). I am not technically inclined and I should not be doing things at the business that I am bad at. 

**TLDR**

I need a short term solution, taking the next step to MVP. I would also like a medium-term solution - a VP of engineering/CTO, at least for the next 6-12 months. I'm not praying to find my long-term CTO tomorrow, but it would be nice. 

**Candidates**

- Option 2: He seemed more honest and more likable to be honest, also plenty of experience running, managing, and growing teams and developing architecture and executing. But no successful exit, and maybe less business-savvy. could be bad or good.
- Option 3: A dev agency that i've run into that i'm curious about. I've taken a call, and i'm very skeptical of agency developers, but they said they would be interested in a cto-for-equity deal with additional pay. If it's close enough to options 1 and 2, maybe i should give it a shot?

I'm obviously confused here, and a little out of my league. I've had introductory calls with all these folks, and have explained that I'd like to start with a very short and strict engagement from a scope to build out the basic next step, and we can discuss longer term contracting or retaining after that.

Advice for dealing with startup frustration?,2,ild51m,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ild51m/advice_for_dealing_with_startup_frustration/,6,1599102226.0,"I currently work for a tech startup, which, as is standard for a startup, has limited dev resources. Right now there are so many issues with our current products and a lot of awful manual processes that result in poor customer experiences and increasing already negative margins.

There are countless things I know would help improve our situation and lessen the increasing amount of money we’re bleeding out with the current state of things. The big catch: these improvements would require some amount of dev work which pretty much means any hope of implementing the solution is dead on arrival. Any time you mention the “d” word, you risk getting tarred and feathered. I know our resources are limited (it’s a startup, after all), but I’ve tried so incredibly hard to make folks in the organization understand how much we could save in operational costs (yes, I’ve done the research and provided data) in the long run if we just put some resources toward doing the dev work for improving existing products, but it just never goes anywhere. The organization as a whole only prioritizes the “next big thing.” It’s like endless MVPs without a solidified, profitable product. I know part of being a startup is seeing what sticks, but most of the time it feels like we’re not even waiting to see if something sticks.

Is this something I need to just stop worrying about and if the company goes belly up because of it, so be it? Honestly, there are so many days where I want to throw my hands up in the air.

Peter Thiel talked about innovation being more in deep tech now, but where does that leave some like a Steve Jobs (drop-out), a Brian Chesky, or a Travis Kalanick? 

I understand entrepreneurship is about solving problems, but I do aspire to create something great even though the statistical chances are not in my favour. It worries me, to be honest. Was I born in the wrong and wish I was born in the 80’s/90’s/2000’s when all of the innovations we see now were just starting? Should I have gone into biotech or get some PhD so I could create a more impactful company or something?

It just seems that the likes of Apple, AirBnB, Uber, Facebook, etc, all companies started by founders with simple college degrees or drop-outs (computer science, etc), tech has become saturated and there aren’t as many problems to solve for the ordinary person. That’s basically my perception, which may be quite skewed.

The launch will feature over 70 (paid) musicians (and if I'm lucky, a couple of celebrities), who I need to schedule at least a month in advance. I hope to be ready to launch in November (which means I would need to start scheduling in October), but I'm wondering if it would be wise to go live in the middle of what might be an unstable political environment, or if I should wait to see what happens and plan for a late January/early February launch.

Virtual Startup Conferences - Investor Opinions,4,ikzgc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ikzgc1/virtual_startup_conferences_investor_opinions/,4,1599046814.0,"Wondering which way the winds are blowing on the value of virtual startup conference scene for investors.

""Attended"" Collision this year which was considerably less valuable than last year (there was no real mechanism for decision-makers, VCs, and other investors to discover startups). They did have a great 3-minute lightning introduction setup that I quite enjoyed. I know Collision was the first to try to figure out the conference post the start of CoVid but really struggled to find value. Did any investors actually sign up? Did the virtual nature actually make it easier to attend? Suspect one of the challenges is that in the traditional booth experience, you can walk by a display, have a short conversation, and then politely extricate yourself from the conversation with a ""I've got to meet someone"". Virtually - you are a bit more trapped.

I've signed up and paid my pricey fee (plus the CDN to USD conversion) for Techcrunch's Disrupt and it is already feeling a bit like I might have made the same mistake. See they are trying to run a Startup Alley replica (full points for trying). So far, not seeing many fintech startups and a search for decision makers in the space is not showing any obvious worthwhile connection opportunities. For the Investors, VCs, and Angels in this forum - is anyone bothering with the virtual conference format for discovering new startups? Money better spent elsewhere?

And lastly - for anyone organizing a virtual conference... please don't sort your paying startups alphabetically. Does a disservice to anyone with a startup starting with a ""w"", for example. No one is going ""show more"" seventeen times to get to the startups down the alphabet stack.... let's shoot for some randomness to level the playing/pitching field.",1

Female and Male Co-Founders Who Have Not Met Before...Will This Partnership Work?,1,ikpqzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ikpqzm/female_and_male_cofounders_who_have_not_met/,15,1599013372.0,"Hi all,

I've been searching for a local technical co-founder to start my b2b online business with for about a year now. Yesterday, I stumbled upon a tweet from this local lady saying that she is looking to join a technology startup as a technical co-founder and she is passionate about technology startups. I clicked on her bio link and I was impressed by her resume even though she graduated from college with a high gpa CS degree only a couple of years ago. She seems like a good fit from a technical standpoint.

I wan to set up this business ASAP and don't want to blow this partnership opportunity up with over thinking. However, I want to be thoughtful about how to get it working successfully from the get go. So, I am here seeking your advice.

I have a couple of points that I especially need your feedback on:

1- I am planning on offering her 40% equity and we both will earn our equity on a 5-year vesting schedule with one year cliff. Any feedback on this strategy?

2- She lives 400km away and she said will initially work part time. So, we will work together mostly remotely but we can meet if we really had to. Could that cause a problem in the future?

3- How likely would a business partnership be affected by having opposite gender business co-founders (two co-founders in our case) who never knew each other before?

I'd really appreciate it if you mentioned whether you've partnered with a technical co-founder before along with a thorough feedback on the above concerns and any other considerations in general :-)

Many thanks all!

Advice on payment getaways for 2 sided marketplaces,3,iklru3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iklru3/advice_on_payment_getaways_for_2_sided/,13,1599001040.0,"Hi,

Me and my team have been developing a 2 sided platform for the last year. We are fully into developing a prototype right now. With a deadline at the end of October so we can start applying to incubators and seed investment pools. 

Essentially we are building a platform for meaningful interaction and exchange. 

I have been researching payment getaways that allow split payments and delayed payments.

The perfect partner would be Adyen but they are only interested in partnering when there is revenue of 20k/month passing through. We are far from launching so do not fit this requirement yet.

The 2 other solutions are **Stripe** & **Paypal**

**Stripe:**  
Stripe is the closest to Adyen and is partnered with Uber, Airbnb and many other big companies. They have lots of local payment methods. In Europe not a lot of people have credit cards and every country has a different system in place. This is valuable because of the ease your users have to pay. 

The down side on Stripe is that they are insanely high priced. On the platform we are creating every user is essentially an active user according to Stripe which goes hand in hand with a 2$ charge per month. We are expecting most transactions being pretty low. So this is an enormous cost if we take 10% of every transaction.

**Paypal:**  
Paypal has the same transaction fees as Stripe but does not have this 2$ a month fee per active user which makes it a lot cheaper. The downside about Paypal is that they require every vendor to have/make a Paypal account. Which might turn people away.   
The other downside is that Paypal has very limited payment options (through a paypal account, credit card, debit card)

&#x200B;

Im looking for advice on what is the best way to go until we meet Adyen's requirements. Paypal might turn people away from the platform. Stripe is crazy expensive but it is really easy for people on the platform to pay with their preferred payment method.

I have seen projects grow and fail because they did not have any clear monetization strategy in place.

So my AGPL was primarily meant as an insurance to at least secure some potential stream of revenue while not giving keys to the kingdom away for free - and also to ensure that somebody with big team and big founding wouldn't take my work and run with it.

Am I wrong? Is AGPL really too toxic?

Is it a better alternative to (say) MIT the core functionality and close source some of the extra functionality?

Our startup have a sluggish growth. I am working on it for last 1 year and the I learned following lessons

1. A B2C startup should begin within a community. You should be physically present within that community. It will make you easy to get early adopters  and if your product is really nice it will help you land new users becasue of the word of mouth publicity.  eg:- If you are making something related to photography, you should be active in a photography community
2. Investor will never invest in a business, they invest in startup. If you are making revenues like a business then it is good for you but not for the investor. Investors need startup like growth. eg:- You have to acquire half a million users within 2 or 3 months of launch
3. Feedback is tough to obtain. The feedback from your friends are fine but real feedback comes from the people you don't know. Here, communication is the key and it takes a hell lot of time to perfect the message you want to communicate with your target segment
4. People take your startup at its face value - You will get one chance to impress people. Give it your best shot. B2C customers are not that accomodative, if they understand or your product or it is not visually impressive they will ignore. They don't care whether or not you improve later. Whatever you are giving no matter how small is it, it should work perfectly.
5. Your product should be able to satisfy their ego or help them save money.

&#x200B;

\--EDIT --

6. If you are a B2C startup you product should have the ability to plug into things common people naturally love eg:- Celebrities, News,Food ,etc. People will only take attention of your product if  you are able to place it within the context of things they really care about. They also need constant reminding that our product exist.  I don't think twitter will be popular if they fail to plug into the news media.

7.  Finding a pain point and creating a pain killer will just work fine in B2B segment. In B2C almost everything start as a vitamin and gradually become a  pain killer or an addictive substance. It is all about hitting the market with a MVP and pivot, pivot , pivot until you find product-market fit.",1

Starting a personal training studio

Hi, 

I’m 22 Y/O and thinking of starting a small personal training studio.  The idea is a flexible pay as you go exclusive space for freelance/self-employed fitness professionals to train their clients. Bookable by the hour as and when you want. With no fixed gym contract/ commitment or rent. The idea came to me during the lockdown period- I bought some equipment for my garage ( power rack, adjustable dumbbells, adjustable bench and olympic bar and plates) and all of my friends really enjoyed working out there opposed to the gym which was obviously closed at the time. I myself have no personal training experience but have a few friends who are PT’s and said they’d be interested in trying out the idea. 

I’ve done some research and have found a gym that offers this nearby, charging £15 an hour slots to personal trainers, via an online booking system.

I’m just looking for some advice and open to peoples opinions on whether this could work or if they have any advice? I have £20,000 saved up to spend on equipment and rent etc.

It takes elements of retirement calculators such as inputting financial goals, asset allocations, debt, and calculates a users chance of achieving their goals on their current path using a Monte-Carlo simulation.

It then allows the users to share these models for discussion with the community to see what advice there might be fore them to improve their chances of success or forecasted median net worth.

The idea is that the modelling tool gives quantitative backing to the advice shared and the community features allow for the crowdsourcing of solutions as well as allow for greater accountability in sticking to a good financial plan.

**Back to the point:**

I'm building out both these things for my first launch. My thinking is that each concept has been tested separately. The finance subreddits already show that people will discus personal finance and offer and solicit advice. The various modelling tools available online or used by financial planners also somewhat validate the usefulness of the product. I feel like what I'm testing is the specific combination of two of those together. Will people be willing to have personal finance traits like income, expenses, portfolio, attached to a user name and shared online? There's a small community on a site called networthshare that functions as a public finance diary. My hope is that with added functionality and a better organised discussion format I can grow it. **As such,** I feel like my MVP should be the entire thing of the **modelling tool, the sharing and commenting, and user profiles with the finance diary.**

I've done little tests before, like posting detailed simulations results based on a users' comment on reddit. Sharing my spreadsheet version of the modelling tool, etc. I haven't actually tested building a community around the modelling tool though. It's a big punt as I do wonder how open people are willing to be about their personal finances. They are hidden behind a username, but my hope is that people will be willing to build up these profiles and maintain them. People on financialindependence use flairs that denote age, net worth, withdrawal rate, and income as account flair.

**Am I being stubborn? Am I testing the right thing? Was there an easier way to test? Am I incorrect in assuming that the separate existence of the various component functions validate the combined product? I know general advice is to have a super bare bones MVP and this thing is taking me months to make but I feel its the way I should go about it. I guess I'm second guessing myself because I'm flying in the face of conventional MVP wisdom.**

**Edit: I more concise way to phrase my problem. I feel like the separate halves of the MVP exist. It's the integration I'm testing. The calculators are personal capital, firecalc, cfiresim, portfoliovisualizer, etc. The communities are all the subreddits and other personal finance forums. It's the integration that doesn't exist.** ",1

Try!

A search engine optimised FAQs page can get you organic traffic from searches.

I heard about it earlier, but didn't implement it until yesterday.

A client asked me to create a list of FAQs to direct traffic to his e-commerce website.

I wasn't sure how to go about it. But yeah, 2 hours later, I had a list of around 50 questions...

Curated it to 30 this morning, and sent. Waiting for the review, but here's what I did -

- Searched Google for <product name> + FAQs
- Searched AnswerThePublic for <product name>
- Searched Quora for <product name>

Apart from those initial steps, also did few other Google searches taking cue from the related search queries. 

And after I got a list of questions, picked the ones which looked search-friendly, and were relevant to the client's product too.

Not sure how much traffic it will bring. But yeah, an optimised FAQs page is another way, apart from blog, to attract some eyes to your website/products. 😅

What else would you do to get as many search-friendly questions as possible?

I created a survey too, however I'm having a really hard time finding participants for the survey even though its open to all. I've posted my survey on Reddit, FB groups and many other sites, however, the response is limited. I'm aiming for a minimum of 100 responses across the world, but I doubt whether it's enough (Would love to know more about this)  

After another round of googling, I found that market research is super expensive as a paid service and costs around 1000$ for a basic results. Now my idea is relatively new, a technological advancement, something that hasn't been prominently established in the market or heard about. How would one conduct market research if the market for the product is relatively new?

I’m a founder and I’m seeking financing. The business model didn’t really qualify for venture, because it’s growth potential is limited. I’m seeking angels, obviously, but looking for loans is proving very difficult. 

Apparently the SBA is not funding startups right now. The lender with whom I was “prequalified” said that they needed 5 years of financials and a minimum of 1 million gross revenue for the most recent year. 

I spoke with a few community banks, and their funds are all dedicated to covid relief. 

Is anyone else financing a startup right now?

EDIT: more details:

The startup is in a niche UAV services industry, and the equipment is extremely expensive, hence high startup costs. It is also a “new” service that isn’t really offered by anyone else.

There is potential for growth, but essentially a maximum gross revenue of $1mil. The model is scalable, but will require a complete duplicate of all equipment and personnel, so it’s likely a few years off.

Online Notary service-Tips and advice,0,ik5vq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ik5vq9/online_notary_servicetips_and_advice/,5,1598934473.0,"Hi everyone!

As the title says, I want to begin an online notary service in Florida. I will also offer in-person services if needed. Traditionally, notarizations have always had to be legally done in person. In 2019, Florida passed a law allowing notarizations to be done online and with social distancing in full swing, the timing couldn't be better. There are not a lot of online services out there at the moment. It seems like I have all the resources to begin. Many of my family members are not only notaries themselves but they are also in the legal field, including my father who is an attorney so I will have a lot of guidance as well as a plethora of docs to notarize for people, hopefully. Secondly, I have an office space that has been made available for me if and when I need it.

Unlike other services, this will not require much marketing as business will mostly come from creating relationships with other legal firms and escrow services. With my extensive experience in sales, I will gladly reach out to them F2F and offer my services. I may also have an email campaign. 

My first steps to starting this up are getting certified as a notary public, taking a look at what other online services are doing, seeing how I can compete with them, and building a website. Apart from getting certified, I don't even know where to start! It is my first time starting my own venture and although it is exciting, it is also very daunting. I am asking for some advice, tips, anything I can absorb to put me in the right direction.

How do people having water-cooler talks in remote working environment?,79,ik4m0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ik4m0i/how_do_people_having_watercooler_talks_in_remote/,75,1598930518.0,"Like other companies, since the pandemic began, my current company started working from home and I saw that the quality of our communication went down since then.

* Most of our conversations are work-related.
* No more casual small talks happening in the kitchen, hall-way or lobby.

Sure, we have a ""#random"" slack channel, but the use case is normally like this: Someone shares a news (breaking news), after a while a few others comment about the content and that's it. The conversation flow is not natural, doesn't trigger more conversations. People think more before writing something down.

The consequences? People feel isolated and disconnected at work, weak team bonding, lack of team culture (esp for new hires).

I'm trying to create some solution for this problem, but first I would like to hear your feedback, understand how people are handling this.

* What do you guys do to bring water-cooler talks into your remote work setup?
* How did the setup go in the last few months? Working? Not working? why?
* What if you can see your teammates around while working on browser (say, you're on Confluence and your teammates are also opening Confluence), and being able to ""wave"" at them and start real-time conversation, how does it feel to you?

This is my first time posting here. I'm a scientist and I don't know much about business and legislation yet.

Unfortunately I can't share many details of the our product right now.

To go forward, we still need some funding, but I'm still not sure if this can be lucrative or if we can patent it, as it is already sold for humans. The dosage and form of administration are, of course, very different, and require many long term experiments, which might be the only things preventing people from copying it.

So, would this be an issue? How can I protect a product like this and keep it lucrative?

I recently have become very fond of the idea of creating an Instagram account for posting my own quotes under my own specific brandname. The idea behind this was to build up a solid fan base, and then start creating merchandise that has my quotes written on it with some cool designs. That being said, I do have a bit of questions as I have no experience in this field whatsoever. Here's the list of questions I have so far: 

1. What can I do to make sure nobody else uses my own quotes elsewhere?
   1. I don't want others to steal my quote posts without my permission, and similarly, I wouldn't like someone else making merchandise of my own quotes and making money off it without my permission. I know it might sound a bit greedy, but I don't like when others use up someone else's hard work and make a quick buck off it without putting in much hard work lol.
2. What's a good number of posts per week to make my account grow rapidly?
   1. Is posting daily necessary or can I get away with 3 or 1 posts per week?
3. Are there any tools that help with the hashtags towards the start when I want to attract attention?
   1. Looking for something maybe like an SEO tool but for insta.
4. Would it be fine if my quotes are posted on IG with just plain backgrounds but the merchandise are designed with the quotes and a related background? Or is it good practice to show the themed background in the post as well?
   1. I feel like having them in plain background for posts is fine because it allows a wide range of designs for merchandise and not just the one that's in the post, but at the same time, plain background posts can sometimes be boring.
5. How large of a page do I need before I start reaching out to big name influencers and asking them for shoutouts in exchange for some pay of course?
   1. Just wondering tbh, Idk why I asked this lol
6. When I do start creating merchandise, should I create a separate insta account solely for that or should I keep it on the same page?
   1. I feel like this is a no brainer, but I just like making sure I'm thinking right.

I think I'm out of questions for now, but I'd really appreciate any advice / suggestions other the answers to these questions in case I missed anything important that I need to look out for.

I am currently living in India - relatively smaller market for donating to charities. I believe I have 2 options but I am really unsure which way to lean:

* **Start small in India and grow internationally later on**
   * I believe the issue with this approach is the app might eventually get shaped to only meet Indian users and fail internationally. Also, being an Indian startup (with almost no brand recognition) I feel international users might be somewhat reluctant to use the app because of India's reputation for scamming people in these countries specifically. 
* **Start small in one of the targeted market (North America/EU/Australasia)**
   * With this approach I believe I can refine my app to further suit my targeted customers but I do not have any investment (bootstrapping + solo venture) to pay for extra fee for registering a company in one of these countries. Also I am not sure how feasible it is to run a business from overseas - if I can not move to that country because of Covid or some other reason.

I want to know some logistics and things because i’m using Stripe Atlas (clerky was just too expensive). Here’s what I want to know-

1. How much does stripe actually do? Does it just file the articles of information, set up EIN, and that’s it? 

2. What are the additional forms and things I need to do after I file on stripe. I heard about an 83b election and a foreign qualification (im based out of new jersey). Are there any others? 

3. What is the exact tax structure of a C-Corp and how do I pay salaries to myself and my co-founder. For C-Corps, we have to file taxes on the corporate level annually and then on the personal income when u pay dividend right? How does that exactly work? Also, there are quarterly taxes. How do those work? 

Those are my questions, looking forward to hearing from the community and their experiences. I know none (or atleast a very minimum) amount of people on here are not lawyers but please do share experiences, and general knowledge from what you all have done.

Im not sure which way is up, as patent lawyers I've spoken to are looking at upwards of $6000 and I'm still in the prototype phase. An innovation patent gets granted pretty fast and will do the job and a design registration is a controversial topic depending on who I speak to.

Does any one have any ideas about how I can leap over this issue as honestly, I'm sick of being very secretive about what I'm making and want to start producing marketing material but as soon as I publish anything about my designs, the materials or whatever it appears my idea is free game for possible competitors.

"Early-stage startup, first developer opportunity, seeking advice",24,ijg2cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ijg2cz/earlystage_startup_first_developer_opportunity/,12,1598835541.0,"**tl;dr:** early-stage startup opportunity to be first developer, unsure if it's reasonable to ask for a high salary and 1% stake.

I'm a senior dev with some decent experience, \~9yrs in the industry, worked at amazon, msft in the past and most recently a couple really successful startups in NYC.

I was recently presented an opportunity to work for an early-stage startup, that is well funded and registered as a Trust Company - afaik it takes a lot of capital to start a Trust company so it doesn't feel that risky. The company is in the blockchain space, but I am purposely leaving out details to get non-biased opinions. Let's just say, I really value the blockchain space, especially working on crypto platforms, exchanges, and anything related to fin-tech (it's an exciting space and the technical problems are very interesting imo). Also, maybe to preempt some questions, the person backing this entire thing is a billionaire and I think if he wants something bad enough he will fund it, so I'm not all that worried about funding. (Lastly I'm okay with this not working out - if it flops, I have enough cash/assets to keep myself afloat, and I have no problem looking for another job.)

If interviews go right this week, I have the opportunity to be dev #1 and will be wearing lots of hats. I know this sort of role is entirely full-stack and will require really digging in and figuring things out. I have some full-stack experience in both coding up frontend/backend/oauth and launching on aws, so I know I will be fully utilized in as many areas as possible before hiring more engineers.

My questions are:

\- What is a reasonable salary to ask? My last role I was making $180k, and I feel I am worth $180k- $200k but knowing how well funded this company is, and how many roles I'll be filling (sre, dev, infosec, and probably contributing to hiring, product/design, etc) I believe I should feel comfortable asking for $220k - is this reasonable? Am I over-valuing myself?

\- What is a reasonable stake to ask for? I previously worked in a startup 2 years ago where the first dev had a 2% stake, and when the company was bought for $2.1B - he cashed out nicely! I was thinking about asking for a 1% stake - is this reasonable? Another way I was thinking to negotiate is to say I'm willing to forego 40k for 2% stake - so 180k + 2% stake - same question - is this reasonable? Am I over-valuing myself?

\- Any other general advice/guidance is greatly appreciated!

However, after detailing out my business plan as well as researching competitors in the area, I'm starting to question if what I'm doing is ACTUALLY considered property management. 

My goal is ultimately to bundle property services such as pool cleaning, yard work, house cleaning, etc. And then approach local homeowners and offer to, well, MANAGE all of that for them. So I would essentially be consolidating all of those services into one single service. That way homeowners need not worry about scheduling, billing, and everything else for 5 different services. 

I'm fairly confident that my start up is, by definition, property management. But the fact that there's is quite literally not a single other property management company (in my area) that approaches this the way I'm looking to do has me second guessing myself. Competitors solely focus on rental properties and working side by side with HOAs. 

Am I missing something important? Or am I really onto something? Thanks for the feedback in advance.",1

I'm extremely passionate about my business so that's where the excitement comes from, however I want to transfer this energy into a more calm and level headed persona as it seems to exude more confidence and looks less amateur.

We both decided that we need these agreements in writing, but we're not sure what documents we need.

1) What do we need him to sign?  I think we need him to sign an Intellectual Property Assignment agreement passing the code from him to myself.  I think we perhaps need a formal Letter of Resignation from him.  But what else?  Does he need to sign anything indicating that he gives up all equity in the company, even though we don't have an existing Shareholder's Agreement?

2) Do these documents need to be notarized?  I've read some sample IP Agreement templates and they require both our signatures, but we currently live in separate states.

How do you maximize employee performance in a full remote working environment?,18,iis2kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iis2kw/how_do_you_maximize_employee_performance_in_a/,22,1598735194.0,"And above all, how do you prevent some employee from trying to ""fool"" you? Do you track activities and hours performed on tasks in any way?

Long story short: I am the CEO and Founder of a  startup with more than 10 people, we are all working full remotely and one of the worries I've always had is to understand how to maximize employee performance. I have always wanted to create an environment of transparency and trust, aligning the team on the company objectives and WHY choices and activities are made. Unfortunately, not all the people are trustworthy and there should be some kind of controlling.

Working all remotely, we do not track hours that are dedicated to each activity, but every week we make a planning call and set the goals together with all the team, in which each person reports an estimate of the expected time to complete the task. At the same time we make a review to understand which objectives have been achieved the previous week. However, almost every week the goals achieved are on average 30% of those planned. And at the moment, if an employee doesn't accomplish his goals and tasks are delayed, there are no consequences. I often avoid creating conflicts to maintain a healthy working environment, but this culture of having no consequences is generating problems because the team does not give enough care to the company goals. There is also one particular employee that is clearly taking advantage of this situation, receiving a salary with a minimal effort.

On the one hand I would like to avoid firing people, we are a small company and every person who leaves hurts us (there is a cost to find a new resource, insert it, train it, etc.), on the other hand we cannot continue to have no consequences if company objectives continue to be delayed and people do not mind about company policies.

I don’t know if I’m the problem (maybe I should be more direct, controlling and bossy), or if I have to track people better, or maybe writing the company policies so that they are clear to everyone.

I would like to have your feedback, understand how you are organized and be inspired from your experiences! Thank you.",1

"If you are granted stock options as part of your compensation package, put money away each month for when you need to exercise them.",26,iie15g,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iie15g/if_you_are_granted_stock_options_as_part_of_your/,6,1598672703.0,"I say this because I did NOT do this and now I need to shell out over $7k that I didn’t really plan on spending.

Even if you stay for a while and you’re at a company when they have a successful exit, in order to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax, you NEED to exercise (ie purchase) them at least one year before you sell them. If you don’t, you’ll likely end up exercising and selling in one transaction which gets taxed at the higher short-term capital gains rate. If your stock has real value, this will make a significant difference in how much money you take home when all is said and done.

And if you don’t end up exercising at all then you have a nice surprise savings account :)

"Startup running out of cash, may miss payroll",3,iicod5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iicod5/startup_running_out_of_cash_may_miss_payroll/,12,1598668429.0,"I've been working as a developer for a small startup (7 or 8 employees) up in Ontario, Canada for the last 8 months or so. At our weekly round table meeting this week, our CEO out of the blue warned us that there was a possibility of ""hitting the wall"" when it came to our cash. I'm not the most savvy when it comes to investing, business management etc. and this is also my first startup environment. But they way I understood it was that our next funding round that was supposed to be coming shortly may be put off due to some agreement we've entered into elsewhere.

Ultimately, what that means is that after my paycheque three weeks from now I may not be getting paid until more cash comes in. Obviously my CEO was trying to assuage any panic about the chances of this happening, but if they decided they had to tell us this, I'm treating that as a non-trivial chance of it happening. They also were quick to point out all the obvious things like we'd have back pay and whatnot once money did come in.

I guess I'm just looking for some advice on where to go from here. I've got some safety net, so I've got a few months of leeway if it comes to that. But I've never been in this position before, so it's all new to me.

My first instinct is to polish up the resume just in case, but see how this plays out over the next few weeks before doing anything further. If it comes to the point of having to figure out whether I want to stick around without pay in the hopes that things get better or jump ship, I'm not really sure how to approach that though. A job search in this economy isn't too attractive, but I might not have a choice.

We all know that Hyper casual mobile games are really doing well in terms of market share and business. But it's also visible that this market is highly competitive and dominated by big publishers like Voodoo, Ketchapp, SayGames etc who have huge marketing budgets, there own marketing channels and cross-promotion strategies.

So in order for indies or small startup studios to compete the question which arises are:

1. How much of minimum marketing budget should be allocated for the initial launch to get some visibility in stores?
2. What strategies should be used for UA (user acquisition) ?

We all know that there can't be such fixed budgets but any approximation would really give more insight. :)

Also feel free to give your suggestions on different marketing strategies that can be applied.

What’s your take on a FB advertising approach?,2,ih7h7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ih7h7q/whats_your_take_on_a_fb_advertising_approach/,1,1598504810.0,"My startup (first real one) is at a point where we are just getting started with advertising and looking for traffic. I’ve done advertising on FB and Google AdWords for other companies before, but I see this as a very different approach, possibly because I’m part of the product development, or due to the nature of a startup. I believe it’s the latter. 

We have spoken to many professionals in the area we aim to serve and all are ecstatic, and we even have 2 large companies wanting to contract us out to rebuild our service to their specific needs. Only problem is that they want us to be exclusive to them, which we refuse to work with. My co-founder and I are able to financially support ourselves and bootstrap indefinitely with freelancing work.

In traditional FB ad funnels, we run a reach campaign with a video or graphic, testing it on 3 audiences. Using the lowest CPM audience, we run 3 ads to with no text, the same headlines, but different graphics/videos. We’d continue to test the big 4 variables (audience, copy, title, and media) in a similar fashion.

I’m tempted to do that with the startup’s home landing page, but I feel like we’d be missing our mark as a startup. I believe we have chosen a problem that has an audience viable to allow us to grow if we introduce our solution in the right way, but thats my problem.

I see many ways we can angle our solution (without changing the service/product) to our audience, and I want to test 2-4 of them against each other. I want to run a single ad trying to get people to visit our link, split testing multiple landing pages, each one focused on a different aspect of our business.

I’d give each adset in the campaign the same audience and budget. I’d measure ‘traction’ by comparing which page receives the most ‘email signups’.

I believe this is the quickest and most effective way for us to prove traction, and find what makes our audience tick. The FB ad funnel I previously mentioned can come after we prove one landing page more effective than the others. 

What are your thoughts? How have you found to be effective in proving initial traction when you know you’ve found a problem that is begging for a solution? Do you take the slow and steady approach, or aggressively test ideas to later ‘long haul’?",1

2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app (ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Is there any potential to this dating app idea? Would you consider using it? Any way we could nullify the above concerns?

How to turn your skills into an online business idea,2,jaeryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/jaeryk/how_to_turn_your_skills_into_an_online_business/,1,1602628910.0,"Hi everyone - 

There is a ton of talk in today’s entrepreneurship world about business trends, business ideas, and trying to find that unique start-up idea. But not a lot of people talk about just simply turning your own skills that you have into an online business. 

Why would you want to do this?

&#x200B;

1. Freedom - this business model can be done from anywhere, anytime, and on your schedule
2. Build once, sell forever - this business model emphasizes building products/services once and selling them forever, so you don’t trade time for money.
3. Scalability - if and/or when you want to scale it’s easy. You don’t need to hire a team or create a big software product, nothing. 

So, what is it? Personal business (or its what I like to call it). We cover how you can start with a skill that you already possess, and turn it into a viable online business. Read the article below, and you can start this online business journey - there are real, actionable steps you can take that are provided.

Let me know what you think!

**Market Background**

Estimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026

Market Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025

Key Players:

Teachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia

And many more.

**Opportunity**

Take .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.

**Summary**

The online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. 

This growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.

Luckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:

\-          Mobile App Development

\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking

\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development

\-          AI Development/Machine Learning

\-          Software Engineering

As developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.

**Market Background**

Online learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?

People are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.

With college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.

The big trends leading online course learning around

Cost

Flexibility

Accessibility

Ease of use

**Dev Opportunity**

This is a great opportunity for a niche market. 

By specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.

The more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.

Like I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:

1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey

People love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.

2. Teach them of development tools – which you know

Just because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.

My tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.

**USP (Unique Selling Point)**

Your unique selling point is within the course. 

Tell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. 

A great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. 

**Next Steps**

If you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:

1. Create an audience

Building an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  

It becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.

2. Build the course without an audience

Yes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.

If you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:

\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.

\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.

\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.

\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.

Once you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  

3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course

If you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.

I know this doesn't seem like the best subreddit to ask this question. However, you guys probably have more of a startup mentality to try something like this.

My cart page has all the forms and fields required in one page - name, email, password, billing, shipping, promo code etc. You have to fill everything before you press submit.

I was going over some screen recordings in Hotjar and noticed that a LOT of people fill out the entire page before abandoning it. Even for $0 purchases.

I am passionate about helping others to achieve their goals, whether it be by helping them to create the perfect resume that targets their job market audience, helping to prepare for an interview, providing career coaching and leadership development. For example, I envision myself developing a 4-6 week program for the leadership coaching. This is where I’d want to work with people looking to take the next steps in their career. Or, someone who is new to management and is looking for guidance. 

My setback is that I don’t know where to begin. I mean, I know what I need to do, but I am not sure if I should start in phases, or go all in at once to offer the full package. My thoughts are that I should start by offering resume writing and interview preparation packages. This will allow me to start building my brand. And then develop a phased approach/timeline as part of my business plan to begin rolling out other services.

I launched a company with a partner earlier this year -- [ProperHandymanMA.com](https://ProperHandymanMA.com)

I work with hourly contractors that will often have expenses to report along with their hours.

It quickly became a pain to manage and track their hours and expenses on my own so I began looking online and found some solutions that cost money (some for free) but didn't do exactly as I needed.

My background is in software engineering, mostly web dev, so I decided to build my own solution and began using it with the team and it's been working out nicely!

The tool allows the ability for users to track their expenses (upload receipt) and submit a timesheet weekly.  Admins are able to view the submissions and approve or mark for further review if needed.

The entire system is pretty barebones but it's easy to navigate and it works.

I want to offer this to a few companies to use for free to provide feedback and help me get it to the next level. 

Would you or anyone in your network benefit from having this system in place? 

Thoughts on marketing and getting this in front of users also welcome.

A widget for local print shop owners to embed in their website that allows a convenient file-upload-to-print service,6,j54q16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/j54q16/a_widget_for_local_print_shop_owners_to_embed_in/,7,1601867971.0,"I recently needed to print out a few PDFs. I tried using the local print shops before heading to a big chain store like Staples, but none of them had an easy and intuitive way to at least start the process online. (upload the pdf, preview it, select print options, i.e. color, double-sided, etc.) Especially in these times, it's very much desired to at least start the process online and then pick it up without having to wait inside a building.

The customer could customize the options, e.g. supported paper types, sizes, maximum number of copies, price per copy, and theming (colors to match their brand). They then get the code to embed the widget in their site.

A very small idea, but basically it would just be a one-time purchase of the widget without having to pay a developer to integrate this feature into their website directly. Of course there are create-your-own-widget sites out there, but IMO they're very general and can be a bit intimidating for a non-techie and they also tend to require reoccurring payments.

**Some problems** I think of:

1. You still need tons of inspiration & creativity to know what to post. Not just sharing a trending news article...
2. Despite these tools, designing & formatting content still takes a lot of time
3. Scheduling and managing a content calendar remains a pain as well as you cannot do it in bulk.

**To solve** these I thought of a SaaS tool that would:

1. Suggest you what type of post, captions, call-to-actions, hashtags and images use in your post based on your business's niche and experts' techniques
2. Generate social media posts based on a curated template library, your brandkit and your design preferences
3. Allow you to schedule multiple posts at once on several social media platforms

**Questions** to you guys:

1. What do you think of this idea?
2. What similar tools do you know come closest to this?
3. How much per month would you be willing to pay for something like this?

I've worked on *many* sideprojects in the past, a lot of which failed. When working on these projects (especially when I was in the early stages), one thing I always wanted was an easier way to collect feedback from users on my site, so I knew if I was going in the right direction or not.

I could reach out to individual users, but this wasn't really scalable - I wanted an automated (+ organized) way of collecting categorized feedback. I also wanted to collect other things, like bug reports and feature requests.

I saw that companies like Stripe and Vercel had feedback buttons on their websites, so I knew this was something that could be valuable.

So, I built ShoutShare - [https://shoutshare.io](https://shoutshare.io/)! It's a small JS widget that you set up on your website, and you can begin collecting feedback from your users. You can do things like trigger the widget programmatically via JS; ask specific questions (ie, ""How was your onboarding experience?""); ask certain categories; etc.

It would be a single page application made with react and there would be bubbles(or some sort of shape) floating around. In each bubble is a company(e.g Microsoft/google or even small businesses).  Users can give any of these company’s a vote if they like that company or had a good experience with them.

In the middle of the page, there would be space for 10 bubbles. For a company to get to the middle, they need to have the highest amount of points. (This can be done in js). 

To generate revenue, I could charge each company something small like $1 per month making it hard to say no. 

The whole idea is it is a visual representation of who the dominant company’s are and the company’s the public actually like and don’t like.

(This acts as marketing for the company’s, a review site for the public and a fun view of who is dominating the world)

Bonus features: 

Seasons - so every month or 2 could be a season and the company’s who are in the middle at the end of the season get a company rating badge. (So if a company has a badge, you know they are trustworthy and are liked by the public). 

Capital Slasher - If a company is in the middle, they have the option to kick a company out of the middle area this is to give it a bit of excitement / gain interest.

One of my dreams is to create opportunities. Opportunities for people to develop themselves, learn and enjoy. For years I thought about starting a business. Although i'm currently employed (working as a UX Designer), I would like to make the first steps in becoming an entrepreneur. Having a few years experience - as a freelancer as well as an employee - in the field of UI and UX Design (2 years), and also as a Frontend Developer (HTML/CSS/Javascript/Typescript/Angular/Vue) (4 years), I noticed i'm not the 'employee-type'. Nothing wrong with that, it's just not me. I'm just thinking to much.

I'm living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. That would definitely make you think: why the h\*ll are you posting this here? Why not 'just start'?

That's because I have one other thing I want to achieve, and that links to the 'I want to let people enjoy'-part: I want to create a **remote-only** business. I've done a lot of research and am aware of the pro's (no country-related limits, no travelling time, no costs for an office and so on) and even more the con's (less and more difficult interaction between colleagues, people who will do different things than work, and so on). It will not be easy, but that's entrepreneurship. In my opinion, people should enjoy their lives, freedom and family more. They shouldn't spend 3/4 of their live in a dusty, colorless office. The idea to make it fully remote was in my mind way before the Covid-outbreak, but this outbreak showed it is possible. More than possible. And now is the perfect moment to give it a serious try.

But! I'm looking for **someone who would like to partner up**. Someone with the same idea(s). Someone who wants to achieve the same, but (just as me) didn't have the guts (yet) to just start. So, do you know someone or is this you; feel free to contact me!

**Idea:** start small (ofcourse); design and develop websites and (web)apps, get a first client (maybe you're a freelancer and have one already), don't give up my (and your?) job immediately. Grow big(ger) by years,

**What I need:** someone that's seriously interested in starting something like this and preferably has some experience in this field (age: 25 - 35) or similar fields (creative industry, (online) marketing, sales..).

**What I already have:** NOTHING. Only some experience, enthousiasm and a lot of curiosity. And a dream.

Hi, 

I’m 22 Y/O and thinking of starting a small personal training studio.  The idea is a flexible pay as you go exclusive space for freelance/self-employed fitness professionals to train their clients. Bookable by the hour as and when you want. With no fixed gym contract/ commitment or rent. The idea came to me during the lockdown period- I bought some equipment for my garage ( power rack, adjustable dumbbells, adjustable bench and olympic bar and plates) and all of my friends really enjoyed working out there opposed to the gym which was obviously closed at the time. I myself have no personal training experience but have a few friends who are PT’s and said they’d be interested in trying out the idea. 

I’ve done some research and have found a gym that offers this nearby, charging £15 an hour slots to personal trainers, via an online booking system.

I’m just looking for some advice and open to peoples opinions on whether this could work or if they have any advice? I have £20,000 saved up to spend on equipment and rent etc.

Called VITAL (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally), the device was developed by engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California to free up the nation's limited supply of traditional ventilators so they may be used on patients with the most severe COVID-19 symptoms.  


""This FDA authorization is a key milestone in a process that exemplifies the best of what government can do in a time of crisis,"" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. ""This ventilator is one of countless examples of how taxpayer investments in space exploration - the skills, expertise and knowledge collected over decades of pushing boundaries and achieving firsts for humanity - translate into advancements that improve life on Earth.""  


The Office of Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships at Caltech is offering a free license for VITAL and is reaching out to the commercial medical industry to find manufacturers for the device.  


During the webinar, you will learn about the VITAL ventilator technology and how NASA’s technologies and capabilities are available to industry and other organizations through NASA’s Technology Transfer Program.

High school students: a platform to network and get involved with entrepreneurship and business,9,ieoqed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ieoqed/high_school_students_a_platform_to_network_and/,10,1598153259.0,"Hey everyone,

A couple of weeks ago I posted here about a platform/app I've been working on for the last few months that enables high school students to get involved with business and entrepreneurship; think ""LinkedIn for high schoolers."" Along with being a social network, one of the central features is that we're enabling you to pitch business ideas to each other and collaborate to bring them to life.

I'd like to get even more input from the community on what features would you look for in a platform like this/what would make you want to use it. I've got a solid chunk of it built already but I want to make it perfect for the needs of the people who will be using it.

Also, I'm doing a soft launch starting really soon, so if you're interested in getting access to the platform, let me know below and I'll send you the link. Looking to get a good handful of early access users so I'd really appreciate it. 

Would also love any other feedback and advice as well on this idea. Thanks!",0

There're a lot of times in our lives that we cannot decide what to buy, choose or decide upon.

Do you think that an app where you will upload images of the things you cannot decide and send opinion requests to selected contacts from your contacts that probably know you well and will give you an honest suggestion?
 
These contacts will receive a link that will open a minimalistic web page with the images of these things and they have to select one of them and could even add a comment why they choose that thing overt the others.

Then, in the app you will see which is the most preferred. 

For example, you want to buy a new kind of clothing but you cannot decide between 3 variants. You pick your closest friends and family members, and invite them to anonymously give their suggestion. Then you see the most suggested item and just buy it without thinking more.

Would you use such an app? 😊",0

Marketplace to bundle service / product,6,ibwft1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ibwft1/marketplace_to_bundle_service_product/,10,1597764197.0,"I often notice that it requires a lot of efforts for different businesses to work with others.

For example, let’s say I’ve a resort with the common 2 days 1 night package.

In my surrounding areas, there are other interesting services that my customer can have access to while staying at my resort. This could be nice restaurants, outdoor activities, and more.

If I want to partner with the other businesses, this typically requires a lot of negotiations and frictions. There’s a lot of wasted time and money before I can launch some campaigns that combine all these other services.

Same thing when I sell products online. It could be interesting that I can boost my sales by bundling up my product with other products. But there’s a lot of frictions and I don’t always know for sure how successful it would be.

Is there a platform that allows seamless service/product bundling? 

For example, I have an idea today that I want to bundle my product A with another seller’s product B. I can then design this new bundle overnight and launch it the next day.

This is more or less done by travel agencies where they would already have designed some packages with places to visit, accommodations, etc up front. But these packages are mostly static in nature and not agile enough.

Not sure how the pricing for the bundle works though. 

Ideally the platform will be a marketplace for businesses to be agile in experimenting service bundles at low cost.",0

I notice that it’s so difficult to get in touch with the required professional on the phone just for a few questions.

Typically the process is like this: google search for the services, check their geographical location, confirm their niche expertise, then I will try to give a call (unpleasant experiences with many loops, redirects, appointment) or write an email (not sure when they’ll reply, have to write again my issues, set appointment, yada yada)

So the ‘hotline’ is rarely a ‘hotline’ in most cases. Unless maybe you’re calling for some help through 999 numbers or suicide prevention centre.

I’m thinking of a simple platform where you can instantly connect to professionals over the phone or video conf without needless forms to be filled in.

For example, I need quick help with my data science project and I want to immediately have a professional data scientist over the phone to advise me on my immediate needs.

The platform will be intelligent enough to connect me with the best data scientist available at a fee or even free.

For professionals, this can be a way to make small pocket money for their knowledge or advisory service and also may lead to other more serious projects.

I'm  looking for some feedback/validation on a SaaS product idea. I figured it'd be great to post here.

The   product is an online online automation platform focused on low/no-code   web automation. There are similar products on the market already but I   think^(TM) that offering both  the ability to perform the automation  using your own computer/resources  (unlimited usage but no scheduling or  advanced features) paired with a  marketplace for pre-built automation  routines, there may be enough  differentiation with just that.

"How would you translate your ideas into a functioning, user-friendly app? What would differentiate it from other apps that may be available? [quora]",3,i3f7vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/i3f7vi/how_would_you_translate_your_ideas_into_a/,0,1596556553.0,"Everything starts with the idea. But the idea itself is not enough. There’s a lot of great ideas for the app, but somehow they don’t succeed. There are some essential steps and requirements to create a great app out of the great idea, and the process of discovering those steps and requirements is called business analysis.

Let’s check those steps :

**I. The idea.** Sometimes we get some ideas out of nowhere, sometimes they come from an analysis of specific problem... Whatever the idea comes from, it needs justification - why is this particular idea good? Does it solve a particular problem? How should it work? Which target group is to be of interest? It’s not necessary to make it long, but at this stage, you should consider a short description of your idea. Make a long story short.

**II. Business model**. It’s all about analysing the business side of the app.

1. **Demand** \- you need to analyse the potential customer. Who are they? What are their needs? Do you want to target a big amount of customers or niche?  
This section should be dedicated to the analysis of the customer - understanding customers' needs and their scale will allow you to create an application tailored to target group needs. Obvious, but sometimes underestimated.
2. **Competition** \- it’s important to know your competition. Becoming familiar with the offer and the operation of the competition will allow you to improve decision-making, e.g. whether there is a gap in the value provided that you could fill and thus stand out.
3. **Distribution** \- creating an app, you should also consider channels of distribution tailored to your potential customers, and available for you (depending on eg. Experience, budget, political situation etc)
4. **Risk** \- as they say: “no risk, no gain”. Every business opportunity has a specific risk. In the case of the app, it could be strictly connected to the app itself, competition or customers. This is crucial to know your risks, as this knowledge is a basis for planning your decisions and next moves.

**III. Product.** A detailed description of the product.

1. **The overall vision of the product** \- At this stage, you need to prepare a high-level but very accurate description of the product’s vision.  
More about the vision [here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/10-tips-product-owners-product-vision).
2. **User journey** \- how the typical usage of the product by the user would look like? Describing the whole user journey allows you to discover all needed elements and features of the product, and also spot the issue points, that can be fixed before releasing your product to the public.
3. **Features** \- After analysing all previous steps, you should be ready to list all features, which your app should have.
4. **Product backlog** \- list of the prioritized works (user stories), which are needed to be done for creating and distributing the final product.

**IV. Technology**. A high-level description of the technology used in the app. It should contain a technological description of system architecture, backend, frontend, and deployment. The technology stack should match the features, your capabilities, user description and many more - I suggest leaving it to the IT expert - he/she will be able to recommend the appropriate technology to meet the requirements.

**V. Delivery**. Here you should decide, how the project should be handled and by whom. Should you utilize any agile framework like SCRUM? Hire a software house/ freelancer? Here also you should consider the budget for the app and schedule of work, ownership of the process and also set communication.

This is just a general overview of how you can use business analysis approach to make a functional and user-friendly app. An experienced business analyst can have a significant impact on application development, as having technical and business knowledge, it is able to reconcile these two aspects and provide a broader picture of the needs and requirements of both customers and the application itself. More and more IT companies provide discovery workshops with the participation of business analysts to help their customers make the right decision regarding app development.

The business analysis uses many tools, but the most known is Lean Canvas, [**here** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ)you can check the real-life example.

When it comes to standing out from other apps, it all comes down to conclusions drawn from the competition and customer needs analysis. However, it is also varied and depends on many factors, such as market size, customer preferences, competition profile, distribution time, distribution channel etc.

The most obvious way to stand out from the competition is to offer potential customers something that the competition doesn't. But that's not the only way to stand out.

You need to find your own way to attract customers - some advice, how to do that you can find [**here**](https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/7-ways-to-attract-app-users).

Simply the best fantasy football app/website in Italy (and potentially more markets),7,i373gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/i373gz/simply_the_best_fantasy_football_appwebsite_in/,8,1596522372.0,"If you play any kind of fantasy sports, please read this; if you don’t, please read this anyway although you might be unfamiliar with a few things.

I have an idea for a new fantasy football website to be based in Italy and focused on Italian soccer. The market is currently dominated by two websites but none of them have enough features or a good enough interface to reach their potential.

I have 25+ new features that I think will significantly improve the game experience, along with a lot of improvements to the app interface.

Another important aspect is the news and analysis about fantasy football: while in the US there hundreds, probably thousands of journalists and experts working specifically on fantasy sports full-time, both via social media, websites, TV, radio, podcasts, this industry is almost non-existent in Italy, there are only a few websites that focus on Fantacalcio (fantasy football) news/tips and none of them provide any worthy analysis or statistical research, which is strange for a game played by over 6 million people in Italy. On TV, there is currently only one 30-minute show which airs once a week on Sky (paid channel that also shows most of the league’s games), but even then it’s just feelings-based analysis rather than statistical, weird a game that’s literally based on numbers.
My first and most accessible goal is to open a website that focuses on statistical analysis of the game with actually useful tips, I hope to do this soon, but the main one is to have a company that takes over as the top website in the market for game platform and media related to the game at the same time, through multiple media resources.

For some context here is some data about the industry in Italy and around the world:

6 million people in Italy currently play fantasy football, as the industry generates €12m/year, making Italy the second biggest European market behind the UK. According to a study made three years ago, the Italian market is potentially worth ~€50m/year.
~90 million people play Fantasy sports in the US, the industry is worth $7b/year and $200m/year alone is the revenue for fantasy-related news.",0

1. Product management
2. Engineering
3. Customer service
4. Sales
5. Client management/implementation

Another aspect is that documentation about a company or product often becomes outdated very quickly.  Referencing stuff like this usually results in misinformation or requires reach outs to the above groups to get up to date info.

&#x200B;

Solution:  We'd like to create an automated way to record user question and responses to those questions.  If a question is asked again we can automatically respond to the asker with references to previous question/answers.  Eventually this could lead to more organic documentation that lends towards conversational Q/As vs searching for a title of a document.

Secondarily, we can build on top of this to identify important unanswered questions, folks who know a lot about certain topics, leaderboards, and promote interconnectivity between different groups of people that are solving similar problems.",0

Understood if you need a full-blown online store with a lot of customization, those are probably the best, however, if you just need a fancier online form like this ([a demo store](https://trampoline.apiobuild.com/router/chopin/store/page/google-oauth2%7C117090713962028193035/7a8c0376-0fd0-4093-894f-e6d0200444d4)), it should not take you more time than setting up a google form.

We were able to find a couple friends within our network to actually launch their store from 0 to live in a day or two, but we are struggling to expand beyond our network. Would love to learn feedback from everyone how could reach audience beyond our network given it's such a crowded field and functionality we could continue to build and offer.

We are working on conversational order management functionality (allow merchants and customers to confirm/follow up/cancel order automatically) using gmail api.

We want to build upon everything that we use for free everyday to keep this whole thing free for as much as we could - our intent is to take advantage of everything free for smaller scale businesses.

Ultimately, we want to enable businesses to pay only what they are actually using instead of a full-blown SaaS solution just because it's the only few available.",0

The future of work is remote. Imagine if there was like a cubicalized co-working space where you would be provided with everything you need (on a sort of a concierge basis) to perform your remote role.


Use case 1: A low-income single mom comes in to do a marketing role, but has no money to buy a proper PC for video editing/image editing. Her cubicle is provided with a high-end PC for as long as she's performing this function.

Use case 2: A refugee is brought in, but has major skill gaps in his arsenal that make him perform poorly. A mentor/coach is brought in regularly to upskill him.

Use case 3: The mom from #1 will need to do a bit of photoshooting for social media content tomorrow. She is presented with a high-quality camera the next morning that she uses during the day and will return in the evening.

"If there is a platform that will let you launch your own monetizable networking apps (dating, recruitment, social, niche), would you use it? What would you use it to launch?",7,huib2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/huib2v/if_there_is_a_platform_that_will_let_you_launch/,6,1595266015.0,"I am a developer with an idea for a platform where any user can launch their own monetizable networking app (ios and Android) -  similar to how anyone can use shopify to launch an e-commerce store

While the platform will ensure the tech and the UI/UX is awesome, the app owners will be able to customize and control parts of the app - such as branding, monetization strategies, UI themes, messaging with the users, T&C etc. 

The tech and hosting will be fully managed by the platform, but the data and the app will be owned by the app owner who can migrate the app and data to their own custom tech platform at any point (no lock in). 

The platform will charge a share of revenue generated on the apps. You wouldn't have to pay anything upfront or until you decide you want to monetize your app. 

Here are a few examples of what you can launch:
1) Any niche dating app. (For you region, or for any cultural or professional community that you are a part of). Or for any other purpose that you can think of. 
2) Any niche recruitment app.
3) An app where founders can pitch to early investors. 
4) An app where designers can meet developers.
5) An app where wannabe across can meet casting directors.
6) An app where founders can meet potential cofounders. 
7) An app where pet owners meet dog walkers.
8) An app where writers can meet folks from the publishing industry. 

The core belief is that there are people who are active in their communities and probably passionate towards solving a problem that their community faces - and if tech is no longer a barrier (free to launch and no expertise needed) - they can build really valuable networks and can monetize them (through the built in the features).

Would you use such a platform? What would you use it to launch?",0
Personalized career progression/road mapping,11,hu58yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/hu58yk/personalized_career_progressionroad_mapping/,6,1595211811.0,"**Problem:** Millions of people will need to adjust to the ""new"" job market. Many - particularly underserved populations (ethnic minorities, elderly, youth, disabled, refugees, etc.) - will not be able to secure a job, unless they learn new skills. even despite already having transferrable skills of their own.

**Solution:**  
A platform that - while also partnering with educational institutions (for teaching), employers (for access to traineeships), non-profits and governments (for financial support) - provides a personalized road map for underprivileged communities or, in general, those that need to reskill. The use case is as follows:

1. By analyzing previous work AND life experiences, interests, skills, psychometrics, etc. it generates your current skill/employment profile.
2. It compares your current profile with the skill profile of a future-proof role that is the closest to both your current skill profile and relevant for your interests (eg.: a technician of today could become a collaborative robot specialist with training).
3. A personalized road map is generated to guide people on the steps to take. This will be through hard skill development (""Go take this university/online course.""), soft/language skills (""Considering you just immigrated into this country, it is advisable you learn the language and culture.""/""You will be leading a team, have a session with a leadership mentor.""), and short-term traineeships (""This 3-week placement will improve your X skill, while allowing you to make a bit of money on the side."").",0

I am from small country in Europe (population around 1,5 mil) and am looking to create a website (as for MVP) and a platform later on. It is going to be B2B website. The idea behind it is to ask companies to send us their offer (from the company they are going to work with) and we will get them better deal.  


Lets take IT niche as example.   
Client wants to create a website or develop an app. They gather some offers and most likely choose the one with the lowest price (it is 80% this scenario in our country). When the client has an offer, he sends it to our website choosing the right category and just adding their offer as an attachment. After that, we contact our partner network (lets say around 20 companies) who also develops websites or apps. Usually any company here is willing to drop the price just to get the client and since most of our country wants to work with a local company, everybody fights over customers. This way client gets a better price deal for the same project and we, as a platform/website, get money from the partner that made a cheaper offer for a client.   


As for right now it looks like a low cost investment to make an MVP and there is an option to create a final product - platform, where all the money would go through it.

I want to send out a email newsletter 3x a week of just simple nutritional frameworks for those who work 9-5s and have families can follow simply.

There is just so much confusing bullshit in nutrition and health, and it is really frustrating to see as a trainer.

There are some key foundational building blocks to nutrition and there are exceptions and caveats along the way, but for the most part there is a list of a few things that most people can do everyday of there life to improve their quality of life.",0

Since competition is fierce, we've tried to be ""different"" to the rest and offer features such as

\- Periodic scraping (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)

\- Competitive pricing (because we're both experts in the scraping technology, we can optimize very strongly. Are low prices a good idea? example $50/400 pages monitored daily for a month)

\- API: All our data is available through a private API

\- Webhooks: We can notify you when new data is available.

\- Logged in pages: Coming very soon

\- Extension for frequently used browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox coming soon)

This combination of features allows for a strong mix of use cases, some example highlights are:

\- Monitoring prices of your competitors

\- Keeping up-to-date with the latest news

\- Automatic creation/maintenance of your dataset

\- Get your latest stock prices

New style of online grocery store,0,hdnrpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/hdnrpe/new_style_of_online_grocery_store/,4,1592840302.0,"Thought of this idea for a new grocery store. Basically, the whole shopping experience is done over an app. You choose your groceries, select a future pickup time, then pay via Apply Pay, Samsung Pay, enter credit card, etc. There is no ""in-store shopping"", you don't enter the store outside of the lobby. You may not even need to enter the store if someone brings the groceries out to your car. 

\*Who?\* Target market is families/busy parents. You no longer need to bring your two kicking and screaming children through the store, having them yell at you over the shiny cereal on the lower shelf they want or worry about them wandering off, you just pull up and pick up your cart full of groceries within 3-5 minutes. For example, as you lay in bed on a Sunday night, you create your cart on your phone and after making all your selections, your purchase and set your pickup time (free of charge of course) to 3:15 PM. Pick up the kids from school at 3, drive over to the local store by 3:15, get home by 3:20. 

\*How does this differ from Instacart/in-store pickup?\* There is no fee for the pickup service, that's just how the store operates. You aren't paying a person to shop for you or deliver food to you. It costs the same as shopping for yourself just more efficient. 

\*The store\* The storefront is just a lobby. Maybe a few chairs set up in case you have to wait a minute in line or allow them to bag a few final items. Someone greets you at the desk and once they confirm your identity, they hand you your already bagged groceries. Cold items have a separate fridge near the front of the store so those time sensitive items aren't sitting out rotting if you're running late. Another benefit to this concept is it eliminates customer theft. It's basically a warehouse where only employees are allowed access to the food items. 

\*The staff\* Fewer staffers are required than a normal grocery store. There is no longer the same need to stock shelves since it is the only place where products are stored. No need for more than one or two front desk workers which replaces cashiers. Cart assemblers are the vital members as they are basically the ""in-store shoppers"" but they act more efficiently than regular customers since they know product locations and fastest way to assemble a buyer's cart (also the internal software would give an optimized shopping route"". 

\*Money\* Make money from attractiveness of the easy pickup. Save money on less sq. footage needed for the building with no backroom. Cut costs of products for sake of sales by volume (being able to output more products than competitors). Use online coupons on the app/email campaigns as proverbial ""loss leaders"" if needed.

The property just got rented out and we’ve now got shared rental income as well! People have been really interested in how we figured out the legal agreements, holding title, property management, etc.

For that reason, we’ve been working on [Fractional](https://fractional.homes), a concierge platform for co-owning and co-investing in residential properties. We’ve got a team of real estate agents, attorneys, and property management partners who have helped to really streamline the process and taken away the friction/difficulties of organizing and maintaining a traditional syndicate. Investors on our platform are **required to make an all-cash offer** on their share of the property -- no mortgages allowed unless you are buying with family/friends. 

This should be valuable for anyone interested in:

1. getting a jumpstart on home ownership - buying a property to live in w/ family or friends

2. investing in real estate for appreciation and passive income (rental) - this is great for in and out of state investments

3. diversifying their real estate investments while enjoying tax benefits (having direct ownership of fractions of multiple properties rather than 1 entire property -- REITS don't have any tax benefits)

No advertising , no selling info- we keep it as honest and transparent, legal and fair, as possible. This gives constraints, as people need revenue for resources to survive/ for working.

We need people to have access to research to know the truth in science and empirical evidence by comparing sources and information, at some point.

Bee Informed - An idea with potential but without traction,9,h0z566,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/h0z566/bee_informed_an_idea_with_potential_but_without/,25,1591910275.0,">Bring back more customers to your store!  
>  
>Lots of customers hesitate to give you their email! But we found a way to stay in touch!

I'm working for some time on this idea. It's actually working product already, but I'm still missing something. It's about selling the product. Being a B2B, by nature is a bit harder to do a sell.

It all started as an application that could provide you a way to subscribe/follow someone without providing additional personal data (no login, no account, no emails involved). Subscription is done scanning a QR code. Bee Informed is also a mobile app, so you get those updates in the app. Designed to be used for many vendors (whoever is on Bee Informed platform). Such as Twitter is. You choose who to follow. But the catch here is that other side doesn't know anything who followd them. They just have information about audience size (plus some other analytics, but you get the point). 

And it was oriented towards event-based businesses. So, for example if you have some happennings in a town where you would be for a week or two, you can follow what's happening there, without getting spam later because you won't be interested in those offers. Or, if you are attending some trade fairs, you can use it to get updates while it's relevant. Later, you won't use it.

But then we had this situation with corona. And all negotiations stopped, because everything was limited. Not to mention there were no events or happenings. So we switched a bit to the supermarket use case, and in general shopping. Retail sector, shopping malls. Supermarkets never stopped working, and the retail businesses is back in action again. So, use case would be to offer those businesses an oportunity to send their advertisements to the people who wouldnt leave their contact data (for any reason). Have you ever been asked for an email or phone number for a loyalty card or similar? Then you know what I'm talking about.

I'm a developer, so it was full steam ahead while we were developing a POC, but now it comes to sale, and I lack those skills, plus I'm very bad at approaching businesses. Meaning i'm just too slow in finding new opportunities. And it's even one level harder when you live in a smaller city. 

So, my question for you would be - do you have any ideas how to approach retail business, shops on a higher level? It's a chicken-n-egg problem so in order to break it I should definitely close a deal with some bigger players that would attract end users.

API as a service,12,gzwefk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/gzwefk/api_as_a_service/,11,1591766125.0,"API as a service

Hi guys,

I have experience on the energy sector and one of my first tasks in a company was to update power plants information in every country. It basically means prepare good data for the analysts. This data was generally used for electricity forecasts, supply etc. 

They generally hire some interns for this type of research. It’s not rocket science but it’s quite time consuming, and the lack of recent information/reliability can slow down the process. Some interns might be slower than others and they generally don’t last more than 3 months, so they have to train someone else every 3 mo.

I was thinking to do this type of research on my own (since I know how to do it very well), make an api and sell it as a service. 
I was thinking to add more stuff, like hydrogen, energy storage units etc. 

What do you guys think?
Do you think there’s a market for this idea? 
I know it’s not a secret to have a list of power plants per country. Wikipedia has it, and some other pages release those lists for free, but there can be a new construction or decommission that takes a while for Wikipedia to update, or the source is simply missing/not reliable. I would check and be able to provide a source for every single MW listed.

Need help validating an eLearning marketplace idea,0,gzfssn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/gzfssn/need_help_validating_an_elearning_marketplace_idea/,15,1591705284.0,"Hi, I need help with validating a startup idea.

I'm looking to build an online class marketplace (like Udemy/Skillshare), but mainly for LIVE classes. The idea is to provide online instructors with an extra source of recurring income and potentially a way for them to gradually build their next big course through running daily/weekly/monthly classes LIVE. They can host classes LIVE or show a pre-recorded video at a set date and time with LIVE Q&A afterwards. Instructors earn through the student premium monthly membership pool + ads (for free content) + direct sales. For students, the main benefit will be the personal interaction they get with the instructor, which can be difficult with other popular MOOC platforms.

To validate the idea, I created a landing page and emailed around 100 instructors (with around 10K+ subscribers on YouTube) in various niches (cooking, fitness, yoga, etc). The goal will be to onboard these initial instructors so that the students will automatically follow and resolve the chicken-or-egg scenario come launch date.

However, I've only had 4 instructors reply back that they aren't interested and may consider it in future. No other replies since a week ago. I've tried Facebook ads targeting instructors but only a lot of clicks, no signups. I'm hoping this doesn't invalidate my idea.

Is there any strategy I can follow to validate the idea, or is this probably the end of the road of this particular startup journey?

Especially as (some) people get older - how do they maintain such youthful appearances? Some of the older people I know look healthier than anyone I know in my twenties.

I've noticed a couple of things.

- People find skin/healthcare products based on other people's recommendations. For example, all of /r/skincareaddiction is where I've gotten my skin care routine. But it's hard to sift through. There's so much stuff to review!

- YouTube ""skincare"" influencers. I've seen a handful of skincare specific YouTube reviewers. They're new-ish channels that recommend skincare products and get affiliate money based on their playful but informative reviews.

- [Gordon Hayward](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f82dd3c749008dfc87aa2e099a91da10) is an NBA player with awesome hair.

The only way for you to know was if you watched one of his interviews.

- Kit.com is a site where well-known videographers/online video makers post their equipment they use to make videos, and they make affiliate money based off of other people purchasing their recommendations.

- Everybody has a different personal care routine based on their complexion, tone, pre-existing conditions, places they live (sunny, cold, etc.)

Why can't there be a web product similar for understanding what people use for their health/skin products?

I find it really fascinating how people take care of themselves. I don't know what people use unless I actually ask them. I always get wildly different answers. 

I don't know if it's just me, but wouldn't it be a good idea to connect people's inherent desire to improve their health with the products/stuff that the people they look up to use?

if this sounds stupid it probably is. It's basically influencer curation for health products. There's tons of health risks. 

But I feel like there's a model there. I know if, say, Pharrell came out with what skincare products he used...I'd be on that in a heartbeat. But at the same time, some 20 year old with good skin I could not give less of a shit about. 

I would probably never make this because I'm not a fan of digital only products/Saas. I'm actually more interested in e-commerce.

A Better LinkedIn,8,gw70yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/gw70yk/a_better_linkedin/,6,1591261471.0,"**TL;DR**

A better professional network, which focuses on candidate information, more accurate and realistic job descriptions and quick conversational connections between candidates and companies looking to hire, which will cut down on the amount of time and money wasted during the recruitment process.

\---------

I have been thinking about this for awhile. I do a lot of hiring for my company and its always a long drawn out process, whether I do it myself or I use a recruiter. These are common problems I encounter, I have broken down the problems I have encountered for each role in the process: Candidate, the Company and Recruiters with the problem and a possible reason.

**Candidates**

*problem:* Poor CV/Resume Quality  
*reason:* Too many people try and get creative on their CV, using colour and graphs and other nonsense.

*problem:* Terrible interviewing Skills  
*reason:* People get nervous in interviews, they don't feel comfortable, they are not sure who they will meet and what the situation will be like

*problem:* Hasn't done enough research into the company and role they are applying for  
*reason:* Company website is out of date, lacking information from the recruiter

**Companies**

*problem:* Long winded over inflated job descriptions  
*reason:* I don't know why companies do this, giant nonsensical job description, overinflated, asking for everything under the sun

*problem:* Terrible interviewing techniques, asking dumb questions  
*reason:* Those silly ""Where do you see yourself in five years"" questions still exist. STOP IT!!

**Recruiters**

*problem:* Lack of understand of role, company and the candidate  
*reason:* recruiter seem to put very little time into understanding the role, they love buzzwords and often use these talking to candidates, which makes them look ridiculous. 

*problem:* Suppose to be working for the company but have their own agenda  
*reason:* They will literally put forward a candidate completely wrong for the role just to try and fill a seat

*problem:* Acts as a roadblock to information which would help the company and the candidate make decisions  
*reason:* They always keeps the role vague and don't give enough information to the candidate to properly inform them about the company and the role

*problem:* Ghosting candidates!  
*reason:* This is so unprofessional it beggars belief. I have had candidates ring me direct as they never heard from the recruiter. Not cool!!

These are just a few problems I encounter nearly every time I have to hire someone for my team. (I am a CTO for a tech company in San Jose but I try not to do long stupid job descriptions and I don't ask stupid questions :))

Linkedin has just become a wasteland for recruiters to spam people and harvest candidate information and its just a silly circle jerk of nonsense of so called professional people patting each other on the back for no reason. Endorsements are worthless!

I want to create a social network which helps candidates connect with companies. It will put emphasis on helping the candidate keep their CV/Resume up to date, readable and in a format which promotes their best achievements (I currently do this for people wanting advice on their CV. It takes no time at all and the end result is the candidate gets a much better CV to apply for roles in the future.)

I want to remove the disconnect between candidates and companies. I want to have conversations with potential candidates before any formal interview process takes place (You can find a lot out from a couple of short messages whether someone is right for the role)

I want to remove the roadblocking the recruiters cause, by providing as much info up front about the company and the role. The excuse I always receive from recruiters as to their secrecy is because they don't want other recruiters to know about their client (what a dumb excuse, that is a recruiter only problem. If you are good at your job you shouldn't worry about competitors)

So to sum up, candidates get better tools for keeping their information up to date, companies and potential candidates get conversational about roles.

Basically, it would be a structured video course designed to take you from absolute zero to conversational fluency. It would be videos of native speakers introducing new words and then telling a story, describing a picture, etc. using those words.

I spend probably about an hour each week entering all of my expenses into a google sheet so I can monitor my spending behavior. This manual work is tedious and feels like it should be automated, so basically what I want to do is to create a tool that links to my bank account (credit/checking/savings) to bucketize all of my spend into default categories or categories that I create. I know there are apps that try to do this like mint, but when I've tried to use these I find I spend about as much time fixing the categories that it auto-assigns to my purchases as I do when I manually enter my spend in a spreadsheet.

I think there are a lot of neat features that could be implemented alongside this like push notifications when you're nearing or over your monthly/weekly spend in a certain bucket, or an unrecognized category notification for a certain type of purchase which would allow you to put that purchase in a specific category with only a couple of clicks. 

So the basic idea is a homescreen of  how much spend in each category you have and how much of your budget you have remaining in whatever time allotment you choose (i.e., $150/200 dollars has been used for clothing for this month). Honestly it's just a version of the budget apps that actually works and is really user-friendly, which I haven't been able to find yet

During the last few years, thanks to my experience working at Google, friends that own small businesses have reached out to me for help doing testing of **product-market fit and demand validation online**.

For example, a friend who owns an electronics retail store and wanted to sell excess inventory via a sweepstake. To test the concept I put together a **basic ""online user testing stack"":** created a throwaway logo, unbounce page, connected analytics, hotjar, and launched a very small Google Ad campaign.

The concept (sweepstakes) worked so well that with the **validation process we did, that he went and raised a small seed round** (I got some equity!) - this caught the attention of other SME owners and they have asked me to do the same tests for them

Now, I don't want to have a marketing agency nor these sme owners can afford it, which got me thinking: **what if we could automate the whole process?**

* create a throwaway logo and brand
* create an unbounce (or any other type of) landing page
* connect to a Google/ FB Ads and analytics account
* pre-configure the whole thing
* launch the experiment

I have toyed with the idea, presented it to a bunch of people, and everyone got so excited that I have had even **some proposals for investment in my project**. However, to be honest, it has been long since I'm not in this A/B testing, digital marketing world

So the questions for you dear folks is

* **Do you think this concept of automating the creation and the digital marketing stack makes sense?** don't think of you and me given that we probably take 10 mins to do this. Think instead of the guy who owns a small sportswear store in rural Spain, wants to do promotions online but does not have the slightest idea how to do it and no budget for agency/ web designer
* **have you seen products that do the same?**

Let me give you a bit of context.

I'm doing an excercise with a friend to try to come up with a start up idea. The first step is figuring out thing that you are passionate about and look for businesses that already exist related to them. The passions I came up with were history, music (more on the curator side than on the artistic one), and games (videogames, boardgames, anything like that). But finding start ups/businesses related to these has been complicated, especially the history one because all that comes up is ""History of businesses"" or ""Oldest company in the world"".

That is why I come to ask you if you can think about anything that may fill my venn diagram of businesses around this 3 topics, or at least a place where I could search with better results than google.",0

Just as there are people dedicated to designing bathrooms, closets, etc., the home office is something that, while it’s existed for a while, will have a big influx in potential new buyers. Get ahead of the curve by making content, skewing your social channels towards these types of projects, and offering free services to those in need (say two working parents with multiple children at home).",0

I need advise regarding my business with parking tickets,5,gojoaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/gojoaa/i_need_advise_regarding_my_business_with_parking/,8,1590184134.0," Hello all,

I  have together with a buddy from UNI created at business that takes care  of peoples parking tickets. They way it currently works is that people  fill out a questionnaire, which we receives. We will then charge them a  fee, and write their complaint to the parking company.

We  are currently the only business that helps people with their parking  ticket exclusively. There is a big player on the market, which as a  small part of their business, helps people with parking tickets, but  their main business it giving people discount on different services in  relation to their cars for a monthly fee.

Our  problem is, that we cant seem to make it profitable. We have 1600  visitors a month organically, and we have multiple cases which people  send in each day.

I have thought  about making the service fully automatically, where people answer a  chat-bot, and then get sorted by the chance of them winning their case.  They will then receive a document they just need to fill out, and then  use it as their complaint to the parking company. This would take around  2 weeks to make. The complaint would be purchased with a small fee.

My  question is, can you see any other way to make it profitable? What is  we made contract for people who buy cars? What is we made a ""package""  for people where they get discount, and free help with the parking  ticket for a small fee?

If there  are any of you who would like to be part of an already established  business because you believe you can help us grow, then we are very open  to bringing in new partners. We are currently 2 founders, who study law  at our last year.",0

How about a social weather app, where users can upload real-time photos on a walk, beach, hike, or wherever. The photos will be time-stamped with a GPS location. The app will also feature a normal weather report and forecast. 

Potential Problems: users upload unrelated images to weather. Perhaps this could be solved by allowing users to vote on the pictures uploaded and a system that can screen for unrelated or inappropriate pictures.

*In a world of uncertainty, who do you trust will have your back?* I’m thinking of this as an unmanaged peer-to-peer platform providing the framework for people to build a self-reliant barter community. High level:

## 1. COMPLETE A PERSONAL PROFILE

Determine what you'll contribute to your pod community using our questionnaire. The questionnaire would cover core categories of human needs to ensuring everyone is contributing something different (for example, an attorney agrees to contribute legal expertise, a hairstylist or esthetician contributes their services, a therapist may agree to help someone struggling with mental wellbeing, a mom might offer babysitting or home schooling to relieve other mothers when in need, someone growing their own food might provide a certain amount to the community should there be a food shortage, a plumber or construction worker volunteers their skills, etc). \*\*I’d need to factor in some sort of system to measure the give/get ratio.

2. INVITE SOMEONE YOU KNOW TO JOIN YOUR POD

Turn your network of family, friends and peers into a reliable barter community. By following an invite-only format, it ensures that members of your community are people you can count on to have your back in times of need.

3. WE DO THE REST

Our solution ensures a balanced pod infrastructure, so various categories of human needs are met by your community.

Revenue would come from a small one time fee at sign-up.

There is a small possibility that the company that can fix the flaw is a client to one of the main producers.

I want to get started as soon as possible but I do not want to ruin my chances of making this work. Do I send an NDA to the company that I think can fix the flaw first to find out if it is even possible?

What if it is? Then what? I do not have the Capital to go up against these 4 major companies.

To be honest fixing this flaw and making a better product would be great but this would not be a huge money maker. It could bring in some nice income and I think it could lead to other products in the future but it would bring a lot of happiness. .... Thank you for any advice..",0

* Once  the company starts selling a product, NASA will  collect a standard net  royalty fee. This money goes first to the  inventor and then to  maintaining the agency's technology transfer  activities and technology  advancement.
* This  announcement applies to only non-exclusive  licenses, which means other  companies may apply for similar rights to  use the technology for  commercial purposes. However, NASA will consider  further exclusivity if  the startup wishes to negotiate.
* Companies  entering into these licenses are bound by  all requirements in federal  licensing statutes and NASA policies,  including development of a  commercialization plan and reporting on  efforts to achieve practical  application.
* While NASA does license to foreign entities, this start-up agreement is only available to  companies in the United States.

I wondered if there's a need for a service where carpenters would create the pieces (and provide bolts etc) and instructions necessary to build common household furniture (set of 4 or 6 chairs, tables, benches etc). But they would leave them unpainted or unstained (depending on if they'd need to be varnished etc for transport).

People could find something they'd like to put together, order it and the chosen colour and the furniture would be dropped off for them to paint. They would pay per set. They could then choose to keep the furniture or put it up for sale on the service's marketplace or eBay etc. Would have to watch out for bad quality assembly and painting obviously...

I know you could just paint your IKEA furniture so that could be a competitor. But maybe if it really was a service for the enjoyment of putting things together and painting them, and if it was localised (furniture made, painted and sold in your local area) it could generate some nice community benefits.

Image collaborative tool - need feedback,7,gc9rp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/gc9rp7/image_collaborative_tool_need_feedback/,3,1588467469.0," Hi all,

I seem to find myself here often with new ideas and needing feedback so learn the name I'm sure to be back again lol!

Recently came across a tool called [frame.io](https://frame.io/) that offers teams to collaborate on video creation, pointing out issues at certain times and areas and I love the idea so I thought why not do that with images, that could be my niche... turns out they do that as well.

My question to that is because they offer both tools for images and video it looks like they are expanding (they introduced the image tool in 2018), does this give me the opportunity to create it for images specifically? I ALWAYS find myself asking the same type of question ""is it worth it?"" and I've done that with way too many ideas. Of course, this will be a SaaS platform, a paid solution. There are other companies that offer this, but to be honest, of course with everything there will be.

I don’t know what’s on store shelves

I want to know what stores I my general area (geo-location) have on their shelves. For instance, I’m looking for a certain cereal bar and I want to know if it’s at one of the 3 grocery stores close by? I want a smart watch and want to know if it’s at the local sports store or the local big box store.

How can I get this information? I would have to interface with each store separately.

Solution:
Create an app that has an API to store inventory. Users can perform keyword search and get results sorted by distance. 

The typical user would still rely on e-commerce and conventional brick-and-mortar activity but would use the proposed app to locate specific inventory for same day pickup or delivery

I've been searching and trying to validate some ideas and here is another one that actually would solve a problem I have, as well as fix a problem with a current platform. I COULD use another platform for such thing, but what's the fun in that when you could create something better, fewer issues, better privacy and support - especially for something social. Let's get into it. 

[Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) is a place to create events, join and meet people.

The idea is something like meetup, the ability to meet people in person, as well as online (due to the coronavirus, this feature would persist beyond since the virus won't be fully gone for a very long time). To start off, I want to make it directed towards people who struggle with these issues - that's my USP.

[Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) has bad reviews and seems like a bad overall experience so I want to make something that can compete but with the niche to start off with (unless that's a bad idea).

Will be available on web, IOS and Android. Will let people find others in your area (GPS on mobile, location on web).

AI assisted Personal Trainer/ Fitness platform,3,g9tfqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/g9tfqe/ai_assisted_personal_trainer_fitness_platform/,15,1588129897.0,"Hello everyone. Hoping to get an idea validated.

The idea is an AI assisted aggregator app for personal fitness trainers (PT) and fitness enthusiasts.  
The main assistance a PT can give you is if you have your form right or not and the diet plan. If the posture/form is not correct it might lead to very slow results (or worst case an injury). If a PT has 50 different clients he would have to analyze everyone's form which could be daunting. To assist the PT he could use an inbuilt posture tracking AI to see which of his clients have bad forms and concentrate more on them making the process more efficient.  
Also there can be a chatbot-based messenger to answer repetitive questions about diet etc and welcome new clients who want to try out a free trial. The chatbot can assist the client initially with the workout and diet. Later the PT can take over.  
This efficiency would allow the PTs to take on more clients and the clients will get faster results because of the accurate advice. There are many PT aggregator platforms but none that are assisted with AI. So this would be the USP.

Personalized Cut-Resistant Gloves,1,g9hvij,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/g9hvij/personalized_cutresistant_gloves/,14,1588083418.0,"This may sounds dumb, but I think when looking deeper into this idea may show that it has merit.

**Product**: Personalized Cut-Resistant Gloves.

**Description**: The gloves are designed to look the way you want. Choose from a list of pre-made designs, or pay extra for a personalized glove.

**Examples:** Some could be based off things such as Super Mario's glove, the Infinity Gauntlet, or a Storm trooper glove.  Other choices would be common designs like camo, tye-dye, etc. The extra-personal gloves would be designed by the consumer for gifts. (Choose existing design, add personalized words)

**Why:** The majority of cut resistant gloves that exist are quite bland, usually resulting in a solid color, like orange. The creation of this product could provide consumers with more personalized gloves, and spice up their work life. As long as the gloves function on the same level, the design would give an edge over other competitors. 

**Who:** Purchase would primarily be for cooks who are required to use cut resistant gloves for work, or those who do it by choice. Also could be for home use, and the ability for the gloves to be personalized  would be a nice gift for people.

**Concerns:** All gloves would be made to food safety standards, and tested to ensure they meet the proper ANSI cut level.

Shred My Idea: WeWork style DIY Car Garage? (XPost from r/cartalk),16,g94uav,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/g94uav/shred_my_idea_wework_style_diy_car_garage_xpost/,8,1588036280.0,"I'm a young guy renting a small apartment in the Los Angeles area. As such, I don't have access to a home garage in which to do minor car work (replacing alternators, brakes, water pump, etc.). The town in which I live, and my apartment complex itself, is very strict about not allowing any sort of maintenance on the streets or in the parking garages. Disobeying the town code on this can (and will) get you a stiff fine.  


I've found myself thinking lately that it would be great if a company existed that was to wrenching on cars as WeWork is to working in an office. I.e., you pay an hourly (or daily? monthly subscription?) fee to have access to a mechanic bay garage that:  


\-Is well lit  
\-Has a vehicle lift  
\-Has a basic toolkit (sockets, wrenches, rags, etc.)  
\-Has a TV and/or stereo system on the walls (can cast YouTube tutorial videos to, or else have on as white noise)  


Im flirting with the idea of starting a company to do this.   
If such a thing existed, I suspect people would be willing to pay about $30/hr to use the space.  
One of the overhead costs I'm most concerned with is what the insurance on a business like this would be. Progressive probably won't look to kindly on giving a bunch of assholes access to a floor lift that they can kill themselves with. The other concern is, obviously, rent costs. Here in the SFV I can get a building suitable for this purpose for about $4k/month. Let's figure insurance is $3k/month. Utilities and misc. operating expenses (disposing of old coolant, etc.) another $3k/month. I pay myself $3k/month (no other employees at launch). All in all, I've got a monthly overhead of \~$13k/month.

&#x200B;

Let's say I'm open 7 days a week, for a total of 90hrs/week.  
I've got 5 bays times 90hrs = 450 rentable hours per week, or 1800 rentable hours per month.  


With an overhead of $13k/month, charging $30/hr to rent a bay, I've got to have about 450 rental hours per month to break even.  
In essence, to break even, I'd need to have each space occupied for 25% of the time that I'm open.  


I suspect that Saturday/Sunday would be the busiest days for a business like this, so let's assume I have 60% utilization on the 5 bays for 8 days per month (or, 60% utilization for 14hrs/day times 8 days = 112hrs x 5 bays = 560hrs x .60 = 336hrs.  


In other words, assuming 60% utilization on Sat/Sun, I'd get 336 of my required monthly rentable hours on those 8 days alone. That leaves another 22 days per month to get the other 114 hours that I would need to break even.   


Additionally, I think it's logical for a business like this to offer other services, like:  
\-Storefront selling super basic items, like you'd find at a car wash - oil, antifreeze, air fresheners, windshield wiper fluid, snacks, drinks.  
\-Long term or overnight parking for project cars that guys don't want to/can't keep at home  
\-Mobile detailing service  
\-Hot bay for car washes/waxes  


I think this would be successful in Los Angeles for a number of reasons:  
\-Big car culture  
\-It's illegal to work on your car in the street/communal parking garage  
\-Almost everybody is a renter, so they don't have access to a home garage  
\-The garages most homes have are incredibly small and cramped  
\-Lots of poor people who would be eager to save some cash changing their brakes themselves  
\-Lots of upper middle class people who would be eager to have a good, clean, well lit space to work on a project car  
\-Temperate climate, so business loss in the winter would be negligible.

Again, assuming a monthly overhead of $13k/month, I've got yearly operating expenses of $156k.   


There are 2,000,000 people in and around the SFV. Figure about 700K of them are working aged (18-65) men.  


If I could convert .2% of that group (1400 people) to using this service for 5hrs per year, I'd be grossing $210k.  
If I could convert .5% of that group (3500 people) to using this service for 5hrs per year, I'd be grossing $525k.   


Again, this completely discounts rentals to women (which I'd imagine will be close enough to 0 to call it 0), and profits from the storefront, parking, detailing, and car wash side of the business.  


Am I totally insane? Or is this doable? I recognize that I'd probably need about $250k-400k to get this started, but is there anything glaring that I am missing?  
Assuming I'm not totally wrong about the insurance costs (I believe I'm probably pretty close; the national average for monthly premiums for a fully-covered normal auto garage is about $700; I'm figuring for a place like this mine would be about $3k - big assumption).",0

People could make their home into small fulfillment houses to make extra money. Seller would send a large batch of his products to fulfillment house, where it would be stored until seller asks to ship particular item. Fulfillment house would get a fee for storage and/or shipment.

Main benefit for seller is a better reach for buyers because more people would buy your product if you offer lower shipping time. For example, chinese seller could sell products stored in fulfillment house from europe to more european buyers. Benefit for buyers is lower shipping time. The main drawback here is that final prices would mostly increase.",0

1. I know there are other remote job boards out there. Self-conscious
2. Others opinions might be negative

My goals with this launch are

* Get feedback on the site
* Increase traffic and aware of my site
* Get a paid subscriber

I envision a small drinkable 2-4 oz shot that will be very ideal for temporary relief. More effective than Tums. Tums are gross and require chewing more than 2 or 3 if your acid reflux is bad. 

The product may be similar to 5-hour energy, but with different use and intention. It should be on the shelf of every liquor store and drug store.

We have to return to normal life for sometimes weeks at a time before we can meet again for adventure.

My own group has a text thread going to send meme's, schedule next play, and regale how we narrowly defeated Venomfang.

But how often have you found yourself mid week with that D&D itch? There's no way to 'play'. Sure, there's books, online forums, Critical Role, min/maxing that halfling barb/rogue...

But mostly we're all at work, with kids, at school and simply living normal life.

But what if there was a mobile app that allowed us to scratch that mid week D&D itch?

Not just a group text thread to share another Unearthed Arcana...

An actual app platform that allowed us to literally play in between sessions, not requiring the whole party, or even the DM, to be available at the same time.

This is my startup idea... An app for D&D players to still play in between game sessions. A common mobile platform for the whole party with tracked outcomes and built in tables, dice rollers, etc.

The premise would be for us to play our manually uploaded characters, but not do anything that would affect the group game experience. No experience gained, no combat, maybe no beer?

The app would revolve around material from DMG pg127, ""Downtime Activities"", and more. But everything from official sources, so any group can use the app.

You'd get to playout all the roleplay aspects of the game and our character that often get overlooked by epic combat encounters or that one player that takes the limelight. And a way for the DM to do more world building. Like giving players rumors and anecdotes from the world.

I know how the UX would look and overall platform would operate, but I'd rather not talk about that now.

For example, Carousing, My lvl 10 Wild Magic Sorcerer can wander the streets away from the party while they rest at the Hog's Head Inn. He could gamble away his money. And maybe bring back a benign trinket to the next session he won in an underground gambling ring.  
Or, Crafting, my lvl 5 Barbarian can spend time woodworking and building a house on the outskirts of town. Having to barter resources or run errands. The next session we'd have a house outside Balder's Gate.

Is there some delay between streamer and chat on your platform of choice? Don’t worry, you can put that same delay in for everyone else’s video feeds.

Are you the type of streamer who pauses a video to comment on aspects of it? No need to worry, the streamer has full control, setting the pace for the video. If the streamer pauses the video, chat gets their video feeds paused as well. When the streamer unpauses, chat’s video unpauses at the same time to stay in sync!

A lead qualifier for B2B SaaS companies based around specific sales cycles that B2B SaaS go through.,6,fuj2k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/fuj2k0/a_lead_qualifier_for_b2b_saas_companies_based/,0,1585985669.0,"One of the problems that we're focusing on is called waste of scale for B2B SaaS companies.  


***It's when you are marketing and building a large e-mail list of 1,500 potential customers but in the end, you've ended up as with 30 paying customers.***

**There are various reasons for this:**

1. **You are not targeting the right audience/you don't understand who you are targeting effectively:** Your product isn't a need for business, the right business, or even needed by the right businesses at that that time. It's not like your leads are going to signal that they need your product right away. It just doesn't happen so you're in the wild goose chase trying to find the prince in sea of *per* 1,000 frogs.
2. **You're not filtering out the wrong businesses top-of-funnel:** There are many potential businesses that would be great fit for your funnel but unfortunately, they just don't see the value in your product. You may have already validated your concept, got a few paying customers already, but the conversion process takes months on end and you have to worry about churn on top of that. Qualifying leads top-of-funnel is the best way to ensure that you have higher conversion down the funnel by manually (or automating) identifying traits that leads display in order to ensure that you are getting the right leads.
3. **Targeting a non-essential problem in businesses**: This one has to deal with product-market-fit when it comes to getting right customers. Not all markets are the same. In our case, we went after the CRM market. On the outside, we saw that many businesses use CRM so we've built one with a lead search genius so companies can save time finding clients. If you're curious, you can [check it out here](https://tapdesk.io). What we got wrong was that the CRM market was overly saturated and everyone was comparing us to Salesforce and Hubspot. We built a great CRM but if we missed one feature, we would be losing out on a customer. So, we've focused on what we did first: being a great lead search genius company.

So, going back to the **waste of scale problem mentioned earlier...**

Our biggest problem as a B2B SaaS company is that we can save time finding the right leads for our company, we spend more time trying to convert the wrong leads. Prospecting individual leads works great because personalized conversations but at scale, that's not doable. The more scale you have with incorporating leads, the least efficient you are going to be when converting a lead into a sale.

So, we're turning our focus towards lead qualification where you can spend less time trying to convert the wrong leads and more time converting qualified leads and generating revenue for your B2B SaaS. [For more info, feel free to look here.](https://tapdesk.io/leads)

Medical Device Startup,2,ft1zmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ft1zmx/medical_device_startup/,5,1585784091.0,"Medical Device Startups

Hi everyone, hope y’all are doing safe and healthy during this crazy time. 

I am currently a senior in high school and created a medical device last summer - at the University of Houston under a post-doctorate mentor - that aids in the wound healing process. It became a finalist at a couple national/international high school business competitions and I know it’s something I really want to pursue given the increasing global burn care/wound care market size, and the many stakeholders involved.

So, I filed for a provisional patent as the sole owner of this device, this January on the medical device. My mentor wasn’t interested and was leaving to work at NASA.

My initial prototypes of this device did not come out as how imagined but I filed the provisional patent based on what I expected it would look like. 

Now, I will be heading to the University of Texas at Austin and I am unsure what my next steps should be. I tried contacting a few professors there to be my mentor/adviser, through email, but they told me they cannot work on an outside filed patent or were not interested. I finally joined the research group of a biomaterials professor and eventually plan on asking him how to improve my device when I get there.

My question is, if I do happen to improve my device at the University Of Texas, will the university try and claim ip or rights on my device if I use their resources to help build my device.

Another option is to try contacting a local angel network, to try and raise the money and find connections through them to locate a lab + researchers to improve the device, but I know most will either not be interested or take a large chunk of the company. University of Texas does have a few entrepreneurship/startup clubs to help launch startups but not sure how much it will help as I basically need to improve my medical device first. Any ideas on what I should do. Thanks.",0

Every time you discuss with local people some of them complain about local policy or thing that should be fixed by local policy Makers, so I think that an app like that could benefit resident to solve problems themselves (by raising funds) or solve local problems by bringing them to local public officials.

Once you decide the recipe, then you can go to the store and collect all the ingredients, or you can order and deliver to your house using the grocery delivery apps.

It is basically like OfferUp, letgo and Facebook marketplace but on those apps, we have to find for the new items. so instead of searching new items, this will be dedicated app for all the new items you want to buy/sell and also on those App you will not get the good price because people always think those are used items but if you sell on this new app you will get the good prize because you are selling at lower than the market value but it is brand new. So, before you buy anything from the store you first check here if anybody selling that item at a discounted rate.

The pro sells its minutes or hours on a fix bug live session, or a simple conversation. Would you pay maybe 20$ the hour? ( of course the pro will determine the hour rate). 

Platform would count with the rating, likes to the pros and buyers...comments as well...

Feedback on a product idea 🙏🏼,4,f9ask2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/f9ask2/feedback_on_a_product_idea/,10,1582668590.0,"Hi guys

I'd love to hear your feedback on a product idea 🙏🏼

As Makers, my friends and I  have noticed that in each of the products we have built our user experience has been lacking in anything related to notifications.

Due to a lack of development resources and the desire to invest our efforts in developing and upgrading the core product, we usually follow one of these two paths:

1, We don't develop a notification system at all. In products that notifications are not a critical part of the product performance, despite all the benefits of user notifications (marketing, conversion, retention, etc.), we give up the notification system for other product features and modules.

2, We develop the minimum necessary infrastructure base to create the most basic notifications. Down the road upgrades are needed and the system requires regular maintenance.

In addition, it is very difficult to measure the positive or negative impact of the notifications on users, and to understand whether the notifications are useful and achieve the purpose for which they were created, or are bothering the users and causing them to turn off the notifications altogether or worse to abandon the product.

&#x200B;

We recently decided to develop an independent infrastructure for notification system. (For internal use of our products only)

One that we will invest in on-going development efforts and will invest heavily in unique user experience, management and content system, smart scheduling and contextual systems, dashboard for statistics and insights and of course everything in simple sdk implementation with easy access to API and most importantly after initial implementation the system can be managed and maintained directly from a management panel with minimal need of the development team.

The idea behind the project is to allow us to adopt an advanced notifications system in just a few hours, with each new product we develop and thus stop neglecting this very important feature.

&#x200B;

Now, deep into the advanced characterization and the beginning of the system development, we wonder if this might be a system that companies would like to embed in their product?

what do you think about instant notification system or notification system as a SaaS in general?

Did you have the same doubts about developing a notification system for your product?

Do you think companies are doing enough to provide users with an effective, relevant & customized notification experience? Or will they be happy to get help doing so?

&#x200B;

We would love to hear what you think

Date Night Subscription Box - An amazing surprise night in without stressing about it!,19,f7cjuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/f7cjuc/date_night_subscription_box_an_amazing_surprise/,12,1582327211.0,"Problem:

Great date nights take time to plan and often mean a night out on the town followed by drinks etc.. It can be very time consuming and costly, plus there aren't many fun surprises in it for both parties.

Idea:

We ship you a box for 50/date which includes a ""adventure style"" date night which you can do at home. It could include a fun lego project to make together, some candles, bath salts, maybe a desert and a bottle of wine (if we can figure that out). Then it's the two of you opening up a date night and get surprised with a fun night of activities without having to leave the house (may even save money compared to going out for dinner).

What are some products that could use an SDG Alternative?,1,f6pxfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/f6pxfl/what_are_some_products_that_could_use_an_sdg/,7,1582214821.0,"Hey!

Sustainability in regards to better production methods and reusability seems to become more and more trendy and a bigger part of businesses, and startups in particular, but what are some products that could use a more environmentally friendly alternative?

Product Idea: Anti-Theft Alarm for my Bag at the Beach,7,f4t89p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/f4t89p/product_idea_antitheft_alarm_for_my_bag_at_the/,3,1581900501.0,"I don't even know if this is the right place to suggest such a product. I haven't found something like this, but if there already exists such a device, I'd be happy if you could point me to it. In any case, feel free to take the idea and run with it.

So the basic problem is this: you are at a beach or lake and you want to go swimming, but you have a bag with all your valuables like camera, phone, money, car key or whatever.

There are a bunch of partial solutions to this. If you are there with a friend, one can stay back and watch the stuff and of course you can always ask other people, too, when you are alone. Other tips include things like burying things in the sand or someone even suggested using a diaper as disguise. There are fake/hollow sunscreen or water bottles. You can lock your bag to a chair or tree if available. There are waterproof bags you can take with you. But none of that is very practical.

My solution would be a combination of two or three things. A motion/movement detector like [this bike lock](https://www.amazon.com/Tchipie-Motorcycle-Padlock-Reminder-Motorbike/dp/B07G9XDSRC/) (close the look, movement triggers alarm; btw. movement of the lock itself, not a PIR sensor) in a formfactor closer to [a lock like this](https://www.amazon.com/Lewis-N-Clark-Cable-Lock/dp/B00I5IWCPA/) activated with [a silcon RFID wristband](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0LLSEF/).

I have such a disc lock and use it for my mountain bike. In theory it would already work as is on the beach. Close it, put it in your bag and if someone grabs your bag, it will go off. However, it has four flaws for a beach setting in my opinion. First, it's quite heavy. Nothing I would take on a hike or while traveling. Second, it makes a very loud beep when you activate it. Third, it's very quick and immediately very lound to respond and finally, it still has a key you have to take with you while swimming. The thing is, at a beach I don't want to annoy people with a loud beep/alarm just by activating the thing or by trying to deactivate it with the key (which moves the lock and eventually triggers the alarm, if you are not quick enough). 

So my ideal device would be a light, travel size cable lock with a movement/motion detector, activated and deactivated via RFID band. A little beep signals activation or maybe even a small blinking LED to show it's working. If the device notices movement, then there should be one or more warning sounds, maybe not even at full loudness at first. But if there continues to be motion, then the full alarm should trigger.

The tech should be no problem. For example they use those RFID bands for the lockers at my local pool and a motion triggered alarm should be easy, too. There are small, even [keychain sized alarms for personal safety](https://www.amazon.com/SLFORCE-Personal-Alarm-Siren-Song/dp/B07BV7BRGT/), but you have to trigger them yourself. It doesn't have to be 100% secure. It doesn't matter if the cable can be easily cut or the lock easily destroyed (however, it probably should be water- and sandproof). It's mainly just a deterrent when someone grabs the bag or tries to open/manipulate it. Thieves don't like attention. Design-wise I could imagine something like a very noticeable red disc with ""alarm"" written on it.

I guess there could be other uses for such a device, too. Maybe for handbags. Maybe for securing your stuff at the airport.",0

Ad-spend can be a big commitment when starting up small, and personally, I've found that without a big enough budget it can be very hard to grow.

As an online business creator, I would love to not take the risk with putting up money for the setup of the store (instead, investing my time into the store setup) in exchange for giving a partner(s) a share of the profits (which is always negotiable).

From the perspective of the partners, the people who have some spare money and want to put it to work by investing in a stake of a high-growth potential business, it would mean for better ROI than investing into a crowdfunded startup that will payout in 4-5 years...

Sparing $10-$10,000 to invest in new online businesses being set up can be more efficient since a store can bring in quicker ROI than most other traditional investments. Although the risk can be higher, you get to see the results quicker and learn from it.

Basically, crowdfunding for online businesses like dropshipping shop setups.

A new approach to freelancing,2,f1dmv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/f1dmv6/a_new_approach_to_freelancing/,7,1581305379.0,"I started with 2 problems:

1. Companies or individuals sometimes need to implement some jobs and they are looking for a freelancer or a team and it's very hard to find among many candidates (whey you post a project on Upwork, for example, you may have from 50 - 100 proposals, should you choose a cheapest? the most expensive? how to estimate his/her level of skills? does he/she have needed skills at all?) Another problem after you choose a freelancer there is still no guarantee the work will be done, and on time.
2. If you are a freelancer you are looking for a job and it's hard to find. Your proposal is among those 50 - 100 others and chances you will be selected are very low.

SOLUTION TO BOTH PROBLEMS

Kind of agency. But usually, agencies don't work with small projects but this does. You have a bunch of registered freelancers, you estimate somehow level of skills, experience, etc. When a client looks for a freelancer he/she actually just needs the project (a job) to be done. You (not him/her) will select a worker (it can be done automatically, based on skills) and set up the price. 

If somehow a freelancer didn't do his/her job on time or did it bad he/she will be kicked off the service or his/her rank will be lowered.

The dedicated manager (or a system) will track the progress and if there is some delay the work can be passed to another worker. 

The main ideas:

1. Freelancers don't need to fight for the client. If there are enough jobs they will get it.
2. 100% quality is always guaranteed what allows to increase prices and attract more clients
3.  A client doesn't need to choose among hundreds of freelancers, he/she just gets his/her work done.

The main problem is HOW TO FIND ENOUGH CLIENTS?

I need some help naming my jewelry business. 

Some info on the style of jewelry I create, as well as my brand: 

I design sterling silver pieces & I use real gemstones & swarovski crystals. Bracelets, necklaces, earrings and anklets. 

I'm still working on ""my brand"" but 
best way to describe the style I make  is: 
Elegant, sweet, classy, sophisticated, whimsical & ethereal. 

I'm not great at coming up with names & my brain is about to explode. 🤯

I need to make sure that a domain name is available as well as matching social media handles.

Also, here are the names I've been tossing around - I like these, but not 100% in love & need some more ideas: 

• Touch of Luster 
• Forever Frosted 
• Forever Luxe
• Silver & Stones
• Luxe & Luster

I tried these: 
• Forever Fairytale & Forever Facets were taken. 

My store to be called:
""Charming by Cherish.. but then I realized a LOT of online handmade jewelry stores use the word Charming* or Charm*. + I just never LOVED the name. 

And as someone who replied to me reauested...  
My ideal customers would be:

Rich suburban housewives would be one type, women looking for that perfect piece to wear on vacation, date night, out with the girls.. Jewelry to give as gifts for Valentines Day or Christmas. To wear to a wedding or even prom.

And as an example of my pricing:
It's really all over the place depending on what type of gemstones are used & how much. Also how much sterling is used. And also how long it takes me to make it. But for instance: a 7.5"" 6mm Welo Opal bracelet would be about $175. A 7.5"" sterling bali beadcap & 8mm swarovski crystal bracelet would be about $80. 

Hope that helps?

More thoughts on a paid podcast service,3,evkuxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/evkuxr/more_thoughts_on_a_paid_podcast_service/,3,1580320212.0,"I have been thinking more about the options for a paid podcast app, and put down my thoughts one morning. Very curious as to what you guys thing.


&nbsp;

The overall goal of the project will be to simply distribute and reward podcasts for creating content that you enjoy.
It will also help users in two ways, one it can cap your spending while giving something to everyone you wish, you are always in control of how much you spend.
It also solves the problem of too many people who have patreons etc which may cause you to exceed how much your able to give based on what you listen to and/or force you to choose.
Some podcasts also provide content but do not have a patreon set up, this will help to reward these people as well.


&nbsp;

The main method will be as follows:

1. Users will nominate what their monthly spend is.

2. Expenses deducted.

3. The rest is distributed according to what they listen to, in proportion to how long they listen to each podcast.


&nbsp;

The way funds are distributed to each podcast:

1. Each month we will total the outstanding funds recieved less expenses and publish these on our website

2. The list will be public and have the podcast with the amount of funds available to the podcast for them to collect

3. For podcasts with greater than $X amount we will attempt to reach out to the podcast so they can collect them, otherwise we will just make the list public and let them see it.

4. Once a podcast has verified themselves to us, they can create an account which will automaticly distribute all their funds to them each month

5. For podcasts that do not collect anything, we will keep hold of their funds as liquid cash until such time as they do collect them.


&nbsp;

If a user has elected to subscribe but does not listen to any podcasts in a given month, their funds will be used for expenses and reduce the amount of all others users expenses, allowing for a greater proportion given to podcasts.
In the case that all expenses are covered, funds will also be spread evenly to other users, increasing the amount given to podcasts.


&nbsp;

Project structure


&nbsp;

There are two main arms of the project, the apps/listening medium and the website which handles accounts and back end processes, i.e. fund distribution.
The website will also be where outstanding funds lists are published and other information about the app will be kept.


&nbsp;

The orginisation will be officially ran as a not-for-profit orginisation - this minimises any conflict of interest between us and the operational goals of the project.
The operational goals of the project are to minimise expenses and maximise support for creators.


&nbsp;

Every quarter a breakdown of income and expenses will be published publicly on the website, feedback from the community will be sought on how to best address the operational goals of the project.


&nbsp;

Working with podcasters:

1. The podcast app will use the standard apple podcast platform

2. The app itself will only act as an intermidiary between the user and the podcast service, when users download a podcast it will be downloaded from the podcast owner's servers

3. Normal analytics information will be available to the podcast owner like the user was using other podcast apps.

4. The app will track how long each user listens to each podcast, purely for the purposes of distributing funds in proportion to how much they listen to each podcast.


&nbsp;

A secondary aim of the project is to reduce podcast owners reliance on ad revenue. 
The project will not place any requirement on podcasters to produce ad-free content.
However, if a podcast does wish to supply an ad-free feed for paying users, we will replace the apple public feed with an ad-free version in the app.
This is purely a choice for the podcast owner.


&nbsp;

Thoughts on a free version of the service.
When operating under a free model, the objectives of the project may be hard to meet.
This is because without revenue, funds will not be available to distribute to the podcasts.
However a free version may also be benificial in allowing users to still listen to their podcasts when unable to afford to pay for the service.
If a free version was provided, it would have to include ads to generate revenue.


&nbsp;

In these cases, all ad revenue would be put towards reducing expenses, and if expenses were covered, overflow revenue would go towards the funds distributed from paying users.
The reason for this is that the number of paying users is expected to be much fewer than the amount of free users, and makes managing things like podcasts to distribute funds to more managable.
It also incentivises free users to become paid users because it gives them control over where their funds are distributed.",0
Mini game app setup like a social media app,9,evgxoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/evgxoj/mini_game_app_setup_like_a_social_media_app/,5,1580296725.0,"I posted this idea on r/AppIdeas and was suggested to post it here too. 

The idea is a user experience like scrolling through Twitter or Facebook, but instead of posts the user would see mini games that they could play. 

These games would be simple flash games so there would be no install, and you could have people port them over from existing sites like addicting games or bubble box.

I’m assuming revenue would be ad based, at least to launch it but I haven’t thought about monetization too in depth.

A Solution To LateStage Capitalism? A MultiNational FMCG Brand that puts PURPOSE over Profits,6,etc41i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/etc41i/a_solution_to_latestage_capitalism_a/,7,1579909635.0,"\*\*[Originally posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/eswp0e/a_solution_to_latestage_capitalism_a/)\*\*

**TL:DR - What if an organisation with the brand power / social purpose of** [**RED**](https://www.red.org/)**, and the cool of Red Bull, built a competitor to multinational FMCGs like Unilever or P&G? Could they compete, and win, if they genuinely prioritised purpose over profits?**

**Background**

A [small handful of companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-control-everything-we-buy-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) own the vast majority of consumer brands. I submit to the House that a competitor is needed, but one that totally upends the current hegemons' model entirely. I believe that, done well, it could genuinely offer a solution to the struggles of late stage capitalism.

**Idea**

(In my mind) It would start by targeting 'commodity' products (water, socks, paracetamol, even cremations - to name a few) and simply offer comparable products to what's on the market. The USP would be that customers would be able to buy products knowing that their money was going towards 'making the world better', not towards making a small group of people incredibly rich.

The organisation would be registered as a social enterprise, or even a charity, and would be run in the interest of \*all\* stakeholders (employees, supply chain, environment & community), not in the interest of traditional capital / shareholders.

**It's a brand, Not a Product**

Rather than the strategy followed by companies linked above - which is to hide their ownership behind a 'House of Brands' (allowing them to get away with a lot of shady practises), this company would employ a 'Branded House' strategy, aiming to become something akin to a product kitemark of quality and reliability mixed with positive social value. In short - if you see our brand, you know you'll get a decent quality product, and confidence that your money went to making the world a little better.

**Ops & Finance**

It would be run in a very open way with high levels of community engagement on product, strategy and operations - its whole ethos is to offer an alternative to the aggressive corporatisation of today, whatever we learn that to mean over time.

Any 'profits' would either be reinvested in the company or into social causes guided by our community of stakeholders. 'Growth' wouldn't be a goal, but an accidental by-product of serving a community driven by the desire to see the market paradigm shift to one that's driven by \*conscious\* capitalism.

I can imagine it becoming like the multinationals of the FMCG industry, with hundreds of 'products' in various niches, all centred around a 'lifestyle-brand' focused on 'conscious consumers' with money to spend, who want to know that they're spending it to better the many, not the few.

I could go on, but I also don't want to share too much as this is a project I'm actually working on. Would love to hear thoughts. Hit me up if interested in diving deeper - can share link to our landing page if requested :)",0

JumpMe - Community based emergency roadside vehicle assistance,11,et0hyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/et0hyl/jumpme_community_based_emergency_roadside_vehicle/,10,1579846727.0,"Ever been stranded in a parking lot with a dead battery? Or had a flat tire out in the middle of no where?

If you don't have any friends or family around, or don't want to pay for expensive roadside assistance, just send out a 'JumpMe'. JumpMe members that are in a certain radius will get your request and the first one to accept comes to the rescue. You never know if there's someone a couple miles away that has some jumper cables, gas can, or a tire jack.

I don't want mechanic shops, or businesses on here, because then that takes the community aspect from it. The application will be free, but I'd imagine people would exchange some cash outside the app  for their help.

People always assume someone will help them with vehicles problems, but hardly anyone has jumper cables with them, gas can, or the knowledge to do any type of light vehicle work, such as a tire swap. I've seen multiple people walking on the side of the road with a gas can. But we all assume someone else will help and it never happens. When someone signs up for the app, they enter the 'services' they offer, such as battery jump, tire change, etc. This way, when some sends out a 'Battery start' JumpMe, it will reach the right people.

Been toying with this idea for awhile, but don't know if people would find it useful.

A website to connect aspiring musicians and bands to local venues. [looking for feed back],1,emmztr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/emmztr/a_website_to_connect_aspiring_musicians_and_bands/,4,1578665915.0,"To start I think music is very important, but I have been very unimpressed with what the industry has been putting out the last decade and a half. With an over reliance on catchy hooks and over production, I think its time to go back to the raw, more meaningful independent and unique sound.

So the idea:

This website is going to be a social live streaming platform for musicians to preform for fans over the internet. There will be three account types, an account for the artists, an account for the groupies, and an account for the venues. The artists account will allow them to live stream to their groupies or anyone who wants to watch. They will also have pages that have a description of the artist, a place for groupies to donate and possibly in the future a place to sell there music digitally. The groupies accounts will allow them to follow their favorite artists and get notifications when artists are streaming and if artist are playing live at venues near them. The venue accounts will allow venues to schedule concerts with popular artists near them and notify the groupies of those concerts.

Now I'm more of a front end developer so I have that mostly covered. But because I don't have a lot of back end experience I've been using different services to help me. For example I am using Firebase to set up all the accounts and using it to store info on artists. As you can probably understand, the live streaming part has been a bit difficult to implement. WebRTC goes way over my head, so I've been trying to find over solutions. The two solutions so far that I have been looking into are Wowza and Contus Vplay, but I have not had a lot of success because  of my limited understanding of how all of it works.

So my final questions are:  

Is this a product worth pursuing disregarding the difficulty of it? Would you use a website like this?

Is there an easier solution to implement live streaming for someone with little experience?

Is there anything I should add to this concept?",0

* You could have anyone annotate the landing pages to provide feedback directly on the page while they are viewing it (like Abstract, the design platform). No more having to go back to wherever they found the landing page and write a freeform comment.
* You could have up-voting to make the best landing pages bubble to the top and inspire others (like Reddit, IndieHackers and HackerNews). The best comments and feedback can be upvoted too so the community can agree (or disagree) with criticism.
* You could keep track of every version of your landing page so you can see the progress over time (like revision control) and quickly compare them.
* You could even have tags on the types of design (Material) or tech used (React) so people can find specific examples to comment and be inspired by (like StackShare)
* You could gain credibility in the community as a commenter and provider of feedback by gamifying it with points and badges (like StackOverflow)

Hey guys lmk what you think of Tenantree - my independent apartment reviews start-up!,13,ehp3ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ehp3ql/hey_guys_lmk_what_you_think_of_tenantree_my/,17,1577756093.0,"  [https://tenantree.com/](https://tenantree.com/)

I live and rent here in Chicago - actually i need to find a new place this spring - and I’ve always had a hard time finding enough info about the places I’m about to move into. I guess I could have asked tougher questions to the landlord during the apartment tour, or maybe gone out of my way to awkwardly ask a few questions to the current residents ... but also it’s almost 2020: I don’t have to walk into a restaurant and bother the people eating to find out if it’s good, I can just read a few Yelp reviews and make a pretty informed choice. I must have read like 50 customer reviews on Amazon and Etsy while doing holiday shopping and it’s crazy to me that this kind of info isn’t widely available absolutely everywhere to me as an apartment hunter. 

And there are some reviews around but they’re scattered among several sites and largely skewed by landlords and so I decided to make [Tenantree](https://tenantree.com/), a centralized platform for independent, anonymous apartment reviews. 

It’s a super simple site for now: If you’re looking for a new place to live, use Tenantree alongside listing sites and read reviews from current and former tenants to make sure you make the right decision. There aren’t a ton of reviews just yet so [feel free to look around and leave an anonymous review](https://tenantree.com/) if you want. If enough of us do, then maybe we can get apartment hunting into the world of transparency and customer reviews. 

Going forward I’ll [share blog posts](https://blog.tenantree.com/) that highlight the best apartments to rent and the best property managers to rent from. Tenantree is going to take a while to have enough reviews to be super valuable, so I want to give something back while we’re in the process of growing!

Thanks for the time and let me know what you think. And feel free to share with any renters you know who could use this!",0

I know the custom POD scene is popular right now and i am a fan of new tech like AR and VR so why not  combine the both. The results are fun and I think customers might be interested in a new way to view art.

"Missing persons ""lockbox""",6,efh61a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/efh61a/missing_persons_lockbox/,6,1577313516.0," 

Was listening to a crime junkie podcast the other day and heard about the struggle a family was having trying to get into their missing daughters accounts to try and track her.

This got me thinking, what about a website where one can enter their personal account details - facebook, gmail, credit card logins, phone lockscreen pass, computer pass, findmyiphone/iCloud logins, etc.. as well as leave messages on things they would like to be heard if they do go missing, instructions etc.. Then upon creation of the account they enter the emails and phone numbers of loved ones and those people instantly get emails and texts saying this person has created X account and it now exists for this purpose - in case they ever go missing. 

Still working out the details of how this would play out but right now something along the lines of - if the person ever is missing, the loved ones can go on the website and enter the persons name and their email/contact. Now the user at time of creating the account sets an hour limit - say 16 or 24 hours that they have to respond to a text/call/the app itself with a secret passcode that they set “zebra” and once they text that if the passcode is correct they will receive a text saying “glad to see you’re safe” or something and even if its incorrect they will receive a similar message but at that point their loved one will now receive access to all these accounts in hopes that in someway it can help find the person. 

This is just a rough idea and lots of details are still being worked out, but the overall idea is it would be a yearly subscription, very cheap and mostly gifted from loved ones to other loved ones. All passwords would be encrypted of course with no side having access.

I have an app idea for designers that they can describe how the app looks, what are the elements on the screen, how they are positioned and something like that. And the app can generate a simple wireframe based on that. I'll give an example:

   - `fb_login` button, text: `Log in with Facebook`, color: #000000, position: middle
   - `google_login` button, text: `Log in with Google`, color: #000000, position: below `fb_login`

And it can generate simple wireframe like this: https://imgur.com/9dmRC7Y

Cloud Agnostic Rest API Database for Small/Startup/Side Projects,5,ebp65p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ebp65p/cloud_agnostic_rest_api_database_for/,1,1576577333.0,"Looking for feedback on building a cloud agnostic Firebase/AWS Amplify competitor? [https://forms.gle/N5azq5ynxSiCxv678](https://forms.gle/N5azq5ynxSiCxv678)

**What:**  
I want to keep it simple by abstracting out deployments, and data store technologies. Essentially it would just be a REST API contract with different quotas, and resilience SLA's. Given a hard API contract I could just build the contract multiple times to target different clouds and datastore backends. Want to run on AWS with 10GB of data: no problem. Want to run on GCP with 800GB of data: sure (...if you say so)!

This will target development and beta environments for startups as well as a simple backend solution for side projects.

**Why:**  
1) No need to become and expert in specific clouds, or datastore functionality.   
2) Allows you to decouple your projects from specific cloud providers/technologies.   
3) Simplified setup for side projects/POC's because you are just making REST API calls. No need to setup 3rd party SDK's.  
4) When you out grow my service then just build your own backend! It's not meant to be one-size-fits-all.

**How:**  
1) Pick you datastore reliability (dev=free, beta=$7/m, stable=$20/m, dedicated=$100/m)  
2) Pick your data size (2gb, 10gb, 20gb, 50gb, ...)  
3) Pick your target cloud (AWS, GCP, Heroku, Azure, Digital Ocean, ...)  
4) Setup auth (API Key, Social OAuth, basic, ...)  
5) Start making REST API calls using YOUR favorite libraries and industry standard patterns.

**When:**  
You tell me.  
1) Never... tell me why this idea won't work, e.g. Firebase free tier.  
2) I want to get feedback on use cases and the ideal API contract, e.g. pagination and GraphQL support.  
3) I am looking for beta testers. Yes it will be free during beta! Yes, I will provide generous testing limits (within reason)!

We had a thought many years ago that social networks do a lot to connect people from all over the world, but do very little to foster local relationships.

We came up with an idea for a social network that uses geofences at a neighbourhood level, allowing you to post pictures, videos, discussions, events and polls directly to that neighbourhood, and a map-based search mechanism that means you can look anywhere in the world and see what people are posting there.

We've spoken to a tonne of people where we are from and got lots of feedback that this is a great idea, so we moved ahead with finishing our functional prototype.

Before we commit any further, we are looking for testers to click through the app and register their interest in using our product.

Current internet radio streaming is fine for most uses but there's nothing good out there for gamers, particularly while engaged in multiplayer games. All the bloatware and tracking baked into more familiar platforms leads to unacceptable network performance for the player, and in some cases depending on the platform the streaming app is quite taxing on CPU/memory as well. If you are someone serious I don't believe I need to elaborate on the viability of investing in the video game industry.

**Key features:**

* Zero bloat *(audio ads only - no tracking / background services)*
* Low bandwidth use
* Moderate audio quality
* Music Diversity - No paid prioritization for artists *(think pandoras original algorithms that built playlists without bias based solely on users preferences)*
* Supports indie artists for greater music diversity
* Offline support for subscribers *(in addition to complete ad / promotion removal)*

What about a podcast app where people pay a monthly fee, then, depending on what podcasts they listen to and how much of each podcast, I would distribute funds to the podcasts based on the monthly fee.

I.e if someone was paying $10 a month, and listened to 30 minutes of podcast A and 90 minutes of podcast B. I would take $2 to cover expenses and gives $2 to podcast A and $6 to podcast B.

The numbers are just made up but you get the idea.

The Elevator Pitch

•	Unlimited access pick-up/drop off luxury car service.
•	Unlimited trips to a maximum radius 15km or 9.32 miles.
•	Unlimited Individual Pricing: $39.95 per month.
•	Commercial Pricing: $39.95 per call with fare splitting should customer incur additional mileage*
•	Interactive GPS app to call or schedule trips. Includes trip summary and expense reporting. 
•	Users will be paired with one principal driver and an alternate to build rapport. 
•	Drivers are security services or executive protection certified 
•	White glove airport pick-up/drop off service.
•	Fleet of 2020 Volvo XC90 Excellence and 2020 Lincoln Continental Coach Door Edition vehicles.
 
Areas Served

•	Greater Los Angeles Area
•	Washington D.C. Maryland, Virginia (DMV)

Perks

•	Streaming Media Service (Bloomberg, CNN, WSJ, HULU, Netflix, Spotify)
•	Our app allows customers comfort and media preferences to be saved so when they enter the vehicle it is as they would expect it.
•	Plush teddy bear for those travelling with children

Competitive Differentiator 

•	We are more cost effective per mile than Uber Black or competitive car services
•	We don’t our drivers like people and not commodities. They are all employees. 
•	Our objective is to hiring predominately armed forces veterans and former police. The safety and security of our customers is paramount.
•	We try to pair clients with the same driver, same car.
•	We’re committed to green energy eliminating petrol fleet by 2023
•	We will never ask for nor do we require tips. Providing excellent service is our reward 
•	The wait for a car may be a little bit longer however customers may always schedule trips knowing they will have the same driver, same great experience.

Commercial Industries Served

•	Hospitality (Hotels, Boutique Hotels and Resorts)
o	As part of our growth strategy we will propose hoteliers offer the (airport) service to complimentary to customers.
o	Hotels pay $39.95 per trip however should a customer require our services during their stay we split the fare for every mile thereafter.

•	Studio (Film, Television and Web Media studios)
o	Airport pick-up/drop off
o	Time + Miles pricing
o	Livery Service (Dedicated driver for the day) 

•	Executive Detail (Corporate executives and Government officials) 
o	These drivers are former police or armed forces professionals with certification
o	Time + Miles pricing 


Growth Strategy 

•	We will begin with a modest fleet serving our commercial clients first. (Margins are 30%)
•	Our commercial services will cross-pollinate the consumer business and help grow brand awareness and subscription as customers must download the app to use the service.
•	Following a few quarters of consecutive growth and profitability we will launch our unlimited consumer service. ( A loss leader {unprofitable} but a growth accelerator) 
•	Following an initial round of funding we will purchase/lease a commercial space to facilitate growth and reduce overhead. (Vehicle maintenance and cleaning in-house)
•	Our objective is for the unlimited subscription service to become the model much like it has become for streaming services. Once our model has been proven successful we will begin an aggressive M&A strategy of acquiring and consolidating competitors. 
•	Upon reaching our 250,000 subscriber milestone our unlimited service will increase to $79.95 per month. 
 

Marketing Strategy

•	We will launch our unlimited service on a referral basis. Those interested in the service who are not referred by an existing member will be invited to join our waiting list. Exclusivity breeds envy and excitement. 
•	Relying predominately on word of mouth we may run ads on LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube. Our ad campaigns will be simplistic catering to our industry verticals or unlimited service.  Each ending with our catch phrase “Ask a friend” a nod to our exclusive referral only strategy. 
•	Each user will be granted a username upon downloading the app. This username will also serve as their referral code.

* Netflix, Hulu, and HBO for streaming
* Medium for content discovery / reading
* Eats Pass by Uber for convenient dining

Enter the subscription sharing platform. Upon signing up on the platform, you can pool with anonymous people to share these monthly services. Chances are many of you are already doing this with your Netflix account for example. However, this takes away the pain of finding people to share the account with, and doing the busy work of splitting costs, charging the other parties monthly, etc. Also, the more services you're subscribed to, the more challenging it becomes to find parties to split with. Through this platform, you can choose which services you want to share, and we do the lift of finding other parties to pool you with.

You may think we're infringing on terms of service. But some of these services don't care about who is using the account -  simply that not more than X number of people are using it at any given time.

Some pain points that come to mind

I am looking to build some free or extremely cheap tools for side projects or startups in the proof of concept, alpha, or beta stage. What tools would get your projects in front of users faster? Here are a few that I have built, or am considering:

1. BFF (back end for front end): REST API data service similar to \`JsonServer\` but scales past memory limits e.g. 20+ GB data sets by spilling to disk, e.g. SQLite or RocksDB.
2. Auth\* functionality: REST base services that handle authentication and authorization. Probably password-less, basic, and OAuth. Similar to Auth0 but different flow that requires MUCH less setup. Admin console to manage user and roles with role-based access controls (RBAC) and/or attribute-based access controls (ABAC).
3. Datastore Tools: REST client wrapper for interacting with databases via JsonRPC. I can't always find a GUI tool, or hate setting up CLI connections to remote SQL/NoSQL db's or one doesn't exist (I am looking at you Google Cloud Bigtable).
4. Light Weight FaaS: Similar to [https://runkit.com](https://runkit.com/) but less focused on REPL experience and more geared toward REST execution.
5. CRON Automation: Scheduled webhook and/or script execution.
6. Light Weight Metrics: push based simple metrics/dashboard. I hate settings up prometheus/Graphana for simple visualizations.
7. Online dev environment: I have enjoyed [https://codesandbox.io/](https://codesandbox.io/), [https://runkit.com/](https://runkit.com/) but any non-trivial FE project lags live-reload dev servers, or any server/container based project fails to restart at some point.

But motivation is a bitch. You might tempted to hit the gym for a week, but once that initial drive burns off you’re back to square one.  Something changed when I moved in with my current roommates - we hold each other accountable. I’ve been working out almost every morning and eating great. Seeing positive changes on my roommates, I feel the urge to step up. 

Going back to the app idea. I think theres a potential for an app which gamify habit building. The MVP would  be super simple. Think of the fasting app, ZERO. I love that’s keep tracks all the participants; “200k people fasting right now”. Similarly, this app will allow the user to track their habit building activities. The user may choose a habit from a list of presets and start tracking. Everyday you will be reminded to update your goal: either yes/no. Base on your entries, the app figures out how you rank against your group + you will get notified when your group update theirs.

Depending on the size of the business moving offices can be a HUGE undertaking.

You have to buy the right amount of supplies, hire contractors to install tvs' update billing address, move all the furniture, and all during the weekend so your staff doesn't miss a day of work to do it.

I've dealt with 5 office moves in my career and it's a beast of a project, for first time office movers it's always a massive undertaking, what if for a flat fee you can have software to make the office move an easier process.

This would include a built in checklist / sanity check on what you should be thinking about

Prompts to make sure you're on budget for the move

Due dates so you know you what to do and when to do it.

I wanted to get everyone's opinion if I have a viable idea or if the market would be too small please. Quick background on me, I work as an ocean lifeguard for the City of San Diego and deal with 1000's of stingray victim's each year. In an attempt to cut down on the number a victims, a common phase around the California & Florida beaches is to do the ""stingray shuffle.""

The stingray shuffle is the act of shuffling your feet along the ocean floor so that it scares the stingrays off before they have a chance to sting you. This phrase is all over the news, especially during the Summer and most people in my city have heard of it. If you do a quick google search, it also has a good amount of results as many people are terrified of them.

The treatment is to simply control the bleeding first, then to soak your foot in hot water until the pain subsides. Treatment generally takes 45 minutes to 2 hours with allergic reactions being very rare.

My question is, is there anyway to turn this into a business? If so, what do you feel is the best way to make any money? Make an informational website with ads/ affiliate links? Sell t-shirts and other apparel ? Sell first aid kits? I already own the domain name [stingrayshuffle.com](https://stingrayshuffle.com/) but have not done anything with it yet.

As far as other competition, all I found was a children's book from the UK with the name, a children's song on Youtube, and one company with a single t-shirt with the phrase on it. Other than that, I don't see anyone else with an actual brand from the idea.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated as I have been thinking about this for awhile and am eager to get started!

Thank you!

After that undercover period (once you have figured out what some problems are from a sales rep prospective) you look at the company from a top down approach (traditional consulting) and then give a comprehensive report on what was found and what solutions the company needs to implement. This is better than traditional sales consulting because it gives you an unbiased view from both the ground level and the top level (buttom up approach and a top down approach).   ",0

I don’t like the fact of picking players from a list, competing globally and at the end of the season everything starts from zero. I would like to give the opportunity to user to make his own team starting from a random assigned team (within player from the main European leagues) and then building it up with trades and transfers from year to year within a league. In each fantasy-league the ownership of a player is unique and every weekend, so I feel that the users can feel very passionate about their players. Every weekend has to be chosen the lineup for the match against another user and then bonuses, goals, assists ecc determine the winner of the match.
Apart from the actual matches the other main aspect is the transfer market, I would like to built a dynamic marketplace rather than a passive one in which you just choose and sell players to public market.
So here are the questions:
- Do you know the existence of something similar?
- What do you think about it? Would you like it?
- In your own experience of fantasy-football users which are the pros and the cons? How do you feel it could be better?

I had an idea for an open online platform, that struck me recently. Basically it should give people with some kind of  knowledge with engineering/IT/etc. help to create ""products"" in a similar manner to how programmers can build programs collaboratively on github for example. 

For this kind of platform to work in any way, I think there are a few things that would be absolutely crucial:

1. Project management system with versioning (including license versions)
2. People would need the ability to choose a licensing model to work under (open/ usable for a fee etc.)
3. Maybe some kind of guidelines, that heavily encourage modularity of the ""products""? This would be good for a number of things, most importantly, it would enable different licensing models inside of one project and maybe would give some reusability for other projects.

I haven't really thought about this for a long amount of time, and maybe something like this does already exist.

Even so, I would still like to hear what you think about this.

Currently in early stages of working on this idea and wondering what essential items you would pay for out of the below:

1) Company Registration - Getting a Business Number

2) Business Name Registration - Getting a business name

3) Tax Accounts Set Up - Getting Your Tax Number with the IRS / CRA, including State/Provincial, Payroll, and other Taxes

4) Accounting Platform Set Up - Getting Your basic accounts set up for you so you don't have to.

The idea is that when you know you're going to start a business it can be very expensive to go to larger law firms to get all this done, we want to create a better and more affordable way to launch your business by providing all the essential services so you can focus on growing your business and not the logistics behind it!

Find best value used laptops based on user-defined configuration and upgradability,4,dqejs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/dqejs1/find_best_value_used_laptops_based_on_userdefined/,6,1572691569.0,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for feedback on my idea. I've created an MVP here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rFCVJGLkPs5JiIXiJWgrv3SQK1GtiGSwo7yXroL3pBY/edit?usp=sharing

*Problem:* there are lots of used laptops for sale, but finding the one with the best value is complicated, as different computer components such as ram, cpu, and hard-drive space cannot be easily compared. Sometimes it is cheaper to get a computer with less ram, and then upgrade it yourself for example.

*Solution:* an app that would parse used laptop listings and compute the value of a computer after upgrades. This is how it would work:

- the user enters in what model and brand of laptop they want, how much ram and storage size they need

- the app would search through all listings in all regions and calculate the cost to upgrade the laptop to the user's specifications and add that to the total price of the laptop plus shipping, customs, and duties

- the user would be shown the top x number of cheapest laptops

Each component would have a value assigned to it (e.g. 8GB of ram costs this much, a hard-drive costs this much), and each of those components would be affiliate links.

For example, I want a Dell Latitude 7490 laptop with 8GB of ram. It would then search the used laptop listings (e.g. eBay) and find one which is the cheapest (or after upgrades) that would satisfy those requirements. The user would be presented with the link to buy the laptop, and the list of components to buy for it.

*Audience:* people re-selling under-priced used laptops, or low-income people like students that need a laptop for college/university. Would a subscription fee be a barrier?

*How I would make money:* through eBay commissions by automatically sending users offers (if they subscribe to their custom newsletter), or on the website when the user performs a search. Additionally, I can make money from ads.

*Potential issues:*

- I have made an MVP spreadsheet where it downloads posts from a subreddit and finds the best value laptops by parsing the post. Unfortunately, those laptops sell very quickly which is a good thing, but could be difficult to show the best deals to users if they disappear

- some laptops have certain components that cannot be upgraded, can be partially upgraded, or can only be upgraded by removing other components (e.g. if a laptop has two slots for ram, and each one can be 4GB, and the user wants 16GB and only have three 4GB sticks, then they would have to buy 2x8GB sticks instead and discard the other one.) Fortunately, I have the resources for a brand of laptop to check this.

- some listings are contradictory (they say the hard-drive is different sizes throughout the listing), so this could cause the value to be calculated incorrectly

- some required accessories (such as chargers) may be hard to value and to detect, or if the listing includes additional non-standard accessories

- customer retention will be difficult, as customers will buy a laptop and then not have to come back for many years. I could diversify what products are shown (e.g. phones, other products so that they buy more stuff), send them related accessories using an incentive system (e.g. they get part of the commission so they pay less for it plus it is used so it is already discounted), or help them sell their used laptop by suggesting a price for it based on the specs and how fast they want to sell it.

*Additional ideas for increasing sales funnel size:*

Some users visiting this website are looking to upgrade their laptops. Assuming that there is a reason why they want to upgrade (e.g. theirs is too slow, the battery life is not good), then I'm considering creating a laptop chooser which lets the user enter in what is wrong with their laptop, and it will find one which meets their new expectations while remaining good value by not upgrading the other components if they don't need to be upgraded, and keeping them the same.

For example, if their screen is too dim at full brightness, then upgrading the hard-drive doesn't make sense, assuming that they don't intend to use the extra space.

The results of this search would then have commission links and give the user opportunities to buy those laptops.

There could be a subscription fee for a premium option that would email the user best-value laptops as soon as they are available. It would also calculate in what parts can be re-sold from the listing at a profit, if applicable. So if they upgrade the hard-drive, they could resell the old one and get a profit (including reselling fees and shipping) which would make the machine a higher value. It could also include time to upgrade the parts.

Additionally, the premium service could look at many other websites that sell the laptops new and do a price comparison (as sometimes new are cheaper than used) so that the customer gets a better deal. Or if the user is looking for one in a certain price range, it could advise the user that they will have to wait x days/weeks for someone to post a laptop under that price (for example, if the average selling price is $100 and I want one for $50, then assuming the deviation is small it will take a while for one to be listed at $50.)

*Applicability to other products:*

The MVP for this product is very flexible, and can be applied to almost any product, as long as those attributes can be valued and are not subjective. This greatly increases the business cases, but would require learning about those products beforehand.",0

You can buy almost anything online, but there's a ton of junk being sold - sometimes with fake ratings. Giving a bad rating hardly seems fair after all the frustration of time and money lost on a bad purchase. Sometimes it's hard to find just one good product. For me it's a real quiet laptop mouse.

Have you had a hard time finding anything in particular (or something that has high quality)? What is it - and would you support a startup idea around finding and shipping it to you - direct to consumer? It's not just a personal shopping service - but maybe starting out as a niche that finds one particular product. I'm just not sure what product that should be. The unit economics don't work for finding silent laptop mice and competing online against the low (or high) priced junk that's sold now.

You could have a clean interface where you can \*open\* these sites in the interface/app/website without the need to actually to go on twitter/facebook etc.

The ideology is to make all the information splattered across all these accounts accessable with a little twist of design without providing information itself.

Maybe you could top it of that if you get texted in one of these apps you also get a notification on the app.

Best thing is that there would be no legal problems because the app is the endreciever of all the information of the apps. The app would not even have to interact with these great buisnesses except to transform thier provided data into an compressed interface.

Moving Countries,3,dg2exh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/dg2exh/moving_countries/,4,1570761680.0,"Hey y'all,  
  
So I'm just after moving country for the first time roughly about ~2months ago now. I must say I didn't go very far in the grand scheme of things, just from Ireland to the UK. I'd lived in Ireland my whole life, so moving to somewhere like London was a pretty big change. Moving is tough though man. Where I work right now is quite far outside of London, which means long commutes and everything that comes with that. In my short time here so far the biggest thing I've struggled with is meeting people/making friends and just finding things I'm interested in going to do. I can't and obviously am not the first person to experience something like this which got me to thinking.  

We have sites/apps nowdays for everything, how come I haven't come across one to making moving/settling into an area easier? Yes, I get that there's Facebook, things like Meetup, apps even like Tinder/Bumble to help you meet people, but why not have everything in the same space? My idea is relatively simple, one platform that does mostly all of it. Let me make a checklist of everything I need to sort out for the country I'm moving to. If I'm Irish, let me search and connect with other Irish folk who have made the move before. If I like boardgames, let me search and find a club near me that plays regularly ect. 

It's an idea I've been tossing around in my head for the past 2 weeks or so and I'd love some feedback from people on whether they think it could possibly be of use. Is it too like what's out there already? Can you think of other cool features which might set it apart? I'd really love any feedback I can get, let me know what you think! Cheers!",0
"(Real-Life, Real-Time) VR Simulated Laser Tag",2,dfqj9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/dfqj9p/reallife_realtime_vr_simulated_laser_tag/,10,1570698173.0,"Imagine you’re walking through a lush, dense forest filled with green trees, wildlife and lakes. You spot an opening amongst the trees. As you approach the opening you find yourself by a large, open field with a dozen (simulated) soldiers on patrol. You take aim, and pick them off one by one. You’re then shot by another (real) person. Of course, you’re not dead or even hurt because it is laser tag. 

But imagine the adventure, and endless opportunities you could run into? 

Here’s my idea.

Virtual Reality is becoming more and more refined and perfected, why not add cameras to the front, and emulate your enemies through the Virtual Reality? I’m not sure what sort of technology you’d need for this, but if you were to somehow map a portion of land, say 5kms, then use that terrain mapping as a base for your Virtual enemies to walk on. You’d use some sort of satellite set-up around the area to read all of the shooting data, sending the data back to the users. Doing this, could you not simulate a real-time, real-world combat situation through the Virtual headset? 

(These satellites would need to be accurate, and there’d need to be quite a few of them. Sure it might be pricey, but I believe lots of people would enjoy it if it were done commercially)

So you have a large piece of land, mapped out, enemies patrolling, and REAL people like YOU patrolling too. Create teams, run into enemies, work together, capture objectives, all simulated through VR in REAL-TIME. 
Seeing real trees, real mountains, REAL (well not real real) enemies. You could even add enemy vehicles, buildings, airdrops, etc. 

At the end of the “run”, you’d just dock the headsets to some kind of charging station for the next lot of people to use.

[Input on demo] Developing a video chat-based tool for remote teams to stay spontaneously connected,6,dfflnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/dfflnm/input_on_demo_developing_a_video_chatbased_tool/,8,1570648895.0,"**\[Pivoted the product\]**

Hi all,

My cofounder and I are developing a snap video chat-based tool for remote teams to stay spontaneously connected, as though they are working next to each other. We would love to get your thoughts - to see if we are on the right track, and to create something you would like to use!

We know that as much as there are benefits of remote working, there are still a lot of challenges and improvement areas. We heard from a lot of people working remotely in one capacity or another, and the main challenges seem to be:

* The solitude & isolation from less frequent F2F interactions
* Unable to reach out to other team members when in need
* Hard to capture the context of meetings which happened without you

We think our solution addresses the stuff above, and on top of that, can increase team productivity in collaboration. We are also in a Singapore government backed startup incubator which guides us, but need to make sure we get enough interest and product - market fit in order to pull this through!

I’m thinking of something that will merge all the calendars into a single manageable view. It would “force” me to decide which calendar to use upon creating a new appointment and this use the right source address. In addition completions of recipients need to be smart enough not to suggest a competitor to the meeting of one of the companies. 

I’m not trying to create “just one more”  email/calendar system. It would simply leverage the things that are already there (G-Suite, O365 to begin with). 

The clients I’m currently working already moved to cloud services, plus they’re from very conservative, heavily regulated industries so I’m not too concerned about some kind of access problem.

The original can be viewed here. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-want-help-millions-scares-me-j-michael-mike-shuler-ii

I recall thinking about starting my first business when I was 15. I was excited about the prospect of building something all mine. I thought about the money and lifestyle I could have. Here I am years, and many experiences later, and I am realizing something. What motivates me is not money, status or power. What motivates me is helping others. Since that day when I was fifteen years old, I have studied startups, bootstrapping, lean canvas, and on, and on. I have started a couple of companies and researched hundreds of business ideas. I have worked successfully with some cool companies and awesome folks, but I am still looking for that right fit.

I recently began an MBA program through UNC Charlotte, go Niners, to continue my learning and figure out what is next. This has been a journey into learning about what makes me tick more than learning the nuts and bolts of business knowledge. What I have come to realize with a crisp clarity is that what I want is to help others achieve success. I have all this knowledge, and selfishly, I have been gaining it to better myself. In keeping that knowledge to myself I am doing a disservice to others. I recently listened to a podcast by Jenn Scalia, How to Sell Without Selling Out, where she talked about the disservice we can do by not sharing. It was an interesting idea and after reflection, it connected a lot of the dots for me.

This is insanely scary for me though. I do not think it should be but reality check: it is. Why would people listen to me? What if I give bad advice, what if people laugh at me or do not take me seriously? What I know with confidence is that people do take me seriously. I know that direct reports and peers trust me. The facts are that 90% plus in blind surveys say they trust me to do the right thing. So why am I questioning myself?

So, today I take that leap. Today, I start sharing my knowledge. This article is that first step as I share with all of you, very candidly, fears that most of you have probably felt as well. I am going to start sharing my knowledge to help others achieve the success they never thought they could. I am going to share my passion for innovation, startups and entrepreneurship.

You tap the button Pay&Print and by the time you get there you collect what you have printed.

For the providers they can create an account and choose which type of service to provide (color, volume, laser/ink) + the price.

You need to make 2 applications one for the providers, one for the customers, integrate GPS/Map functionality, billing system , payment system , trust/rating features, UI etc etc.

Another issue is the size of transactions, the idea is not to set a minimum number of prints,  so you could have as little as 2$/Euros transactions and I don't know how you could make it viable for me or the provider if the payment gateway will take already a fixed fee on it.

So I just wanna know if you have any idea of the profitability of it. Because even in my case I rarely need to print ( i guess 1 time per month), and if I print i'll do it at the university which is way cheaper. For office workers they already have office printers. Right now I'm not planning doing in it for these reasons, but feel free to give me other insights (idk maybe in India  or in the US there is a huge need )",0
Online Education,5,db2xx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/db2xx2/online_education/,13,1569828135.0,"I am currently a high school teacher and one thing has become extremely obvious to me: the future of education is online. Everyone in the education sphere seems to know it. However, no matter how much I research I can only find a few online resources to use in the classroom (eg simulations to use in science class). This is all well and good but if the future of education is online I want to be apart of creating the softwares that replace the classroom entirely and deliver curriculum entirely on a student paced online format. No more “well if you’re 15 years old you’re at a 9th grade level.” Any educator will tell you that any one student in their class may read at one grade level and do math calculations at another. This cookie cutter system that’s been in place since the beginning of public education is no longer feasible with the technology that we have. I’m not proposing eliminating the classroom entirely, the social aspect of education is extremely important. But let’s face it, kids these days are far more social online than they are in person. My idea is for a software that students can work through and when they reach certain checkpoints they will need to come into a school building to complete some in person educational experiences but these checkpoints will depend upon the pacing of the student and not simply their age. Unfortunately I lack the programming know-how to create a software of this level but I would love to know how feasible it would be. Since the future of education is online it seems crazy not to be one of the first to develop an entirely online curriculum. My idea is that the program would take on the feel of a game that students must understand the core concepts and principles of curriculum in order to progress through. Imagine the power of education that’s actually fun and interactive using technology!",0

Hi everyone, im a passionate being of making workplaces better with the use of tech. Im currently in a global startup incubator program, and I've just ""broken up"" with my tech cofounder which I was together for some time. Wanted to reach out to this space, calling out for any potential CTO cofounders who can be excited to start a company which will improve ppl's lives.

I have an initial product idea on B2B workplace platform business to improve remote working, and it is in prototype stage before targeting the bigger brands starting from Singapore, so a good timing to get on board now. This incubator is ready to provide funding when successful, and support additional funding rounds through VC network.

My short profile is workforce, people, organisation expert across whole of APAC from India to Japan, business consulting experience, and possesses high level global network through global MBA. Seeking a co-founder who has experience as a full stack developer, worked in a startup, built a product, interested in behavioural science, and values customer success.""

\----------------

**The product:** Recommending the optimal work location and environment to employees by using team position information, scheduler integration, and ML algorithms based on people's usage

**Situation:** Currently in a government backed global incubator program, Entrepreneur First in Singapore, with funding available. INSEAD MBA alumni funding accessible. In ideation - prototype stage with customer traction

**Person needed:** As early developer/CTO, you will ideate, build, code, design, maintain the product, and eventually lead your own team. You should be excited about various aspects of tech, as long term this will possibly branch to broader areas such as ML based virtual assistants or hardware solutions. Need to be able to work in Singapore.

**The bigger picture:** This is just the starting point. The concept of way of working constantly evolves with the advancement of technology. We want to empower those who want to take control of their work-life, by fundamentally shifting the mindset of the way “work” is perceived. The possibilities are endless

So we developed Duple to have an out of the box simple-to-use tool that anyone can use, is self-hosted, and that gives you complete flexibility as it works with any storage. Simple. Just download the app on your devices, choose the storage you want to host your cloud, and that's it.

Check it out (we've released a beta): [www.duple.io](https://www.duple.io)

Duple is an app that gives you your private Dropbox at home. You use it to store your data, but also as a sync tool, a backup tool, a file sharing tool. It works just like a Drobpox and a full private cloud, so you can of course access your files from anywhere. The service is similar to Dropbox or Google Drive, but with Duple you own your data is it resides on your storage, and not on someone else's server. The main point is to combine privacy, simplicity and flexiblity. We want to give users an easy access to their privacy. Duple is for everyone. Whether you're a Dropbox or Google Drive user and are looking for more privacy, or a Nextcloud or Syncthing user and are looking for more simplicity and flexibility.

I know Facebook recently launched Facebook Dating, but a friend recently moved to Boston and asked me about perusing my FB friends to see about potential matches for her. I think a big fear of most dating apps is the lack of mutual friends that can vouch for them.

So it got me thinking. What about an algorithm using Facebook’s API that: 

* scans a person’s Facebook friends list 
* filters based on location and relationship status (if applicable) 
* returns a list of potential candidates to reach out to 
* extra: could match against likes/interests to see if there’s commonalities

Facebook Dating probably has the bandwidth to do this, but the idea could be applicable to other apps (Instagram, Twitter, etc)

For college students and young professionals that either want to relocate somewhere new or may not want to leave the city they are in, I think a platform that helps match users with people of similar budgets, careers, and lifestyle preferences would be ideal. For example, in NY, the average Manhattan studio apartment is $2550 whereas a 3 bedroom apartment is $4950. This would mean instead of paying $2500+ to rent alone, a young person just starting out in the city could find a more comfortable housing situation in which they’d share costs and cut it down to roughly $1700. The distinction between this idea and Facebook/Craigslist would be the fact that people are automatically separated by budget, career, and lifestyle, thus helping users to find the most ideal living group in where they are going.",0

Timestamp system using Geolocalization,2,d1teoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/d1teoh/timestamp_system_using_geolocalization/,4,1568076186.0,"Hi Folks, I need your advice/comment on a small system I wrote few years ago. Here's a quick summary of the project:

**Problem**

Many companies requires that every employee have to provide a proof about how much time they spent at work. Usually a third-party companies provides a syetem using Type - 2 Authentication (Something you have) to timestamp at given location on a dedicated hardware.
Once an employee ""timestamp"" the information is sent to a server to track and compute how much time employee work during the day.
This approach has the following weaknesses/drawbacks :

* Hardware system need to adapt to the HR system in way
* Expensive to maintain or in licences fee
* System can be immutable - Location of timestamp device can't be change easily
* Those system are ""blackbox"" in term of source code etc


**Proposed solution** 

My system propose to use employee's device as timestamp device and based on Geolocalization to allow people to timestamps.
The HR have a dedicated tool that allow them to :

* Define for each employee a authorized zone where people can timestamps using googlemaps
* Compute how many time they spent per hour/per months/per year
* Manage employee device allowed timestamping (Employee contract has been terminated, device lost and change device)
* Import data from calendar (Weekend, holidays, employee work hours)
* export data to an other system or generate report 

**Business use case**

* A compnay that wants to lower its costs
* A company where employee are travelling (like services to people and so on)

**Time-to-market**
* 1 year 


**Estimated Cost of developpment and first release**

* 6 mo with 2 developpers to finish a MVP (1x Frontend , 1 x backend)
* 1 year 1 manager to look for customers and build everythig 
* Cloud instances
* 1 web site
* Phones to tests 

**Buisiness models**

* On-premise for big companies : Cost of onsite installation and maintenance
* As a service for individuals or small companies :

App idea: Get an expert to join your meeting,19,cw9zl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/cw9zl5/app_idea_get_an_expert_to_join_your_meeting/,19,1566966183.0,"I have an idea I would like to receive input on. Perhaps it already exists, if so let me know so I can investigate further :)

Also, if you have an idea for the name of the business, please share also :)

\------------------------------------

**The idea:**

Bring an expert to a meeting.

In many cases, people want to get information or buy something without having any knowledge about it. For example:  
\- Buying your first car  
\- Get your website built  
\- Plumbing installed in your house.

If the buyer is not an expert in that conversation, it's easy to get screwed over:  
\- The car might look nice but inside it's almost broken, causing dangerous situations or expensive repairs  
\- The website gets built but since the requirements were not clear it's not really working or not as feature-complete as expected  
\- The plumber gives you high quotes because he wants to repair more than is needed, or uses inferior materials.

The app can request people in the neighbourhood to come with you to the meeting. For some meetings there is not really a locality constraint, since a virtual meeting can be sufficient.

**Actors**

Everyone makes a profile. Users are both ""expert"" and ""novice"" at the same time, since an expert in plumbing doesn't have to be an expert in IT as well.

The expert can add their skills and their location, and get a notification if there is an expert needed. They can give a quote for their time (probably a default setting for price per hour or so). Then a time and date can be set for the meeting.

Just like AirBnB, there is a review system for both parties, which justify difference in prices for the different experts.

**Business model**

The company takes a percentage of the price of the expert. Around 10% is a good value I think.",0

I live as an expat in South-East Asia, in Laos (or Lao PDR).

In here, one of the biggest problems tourists encounter on a daily basis is Transportation. Basically, Taxis are extremely rare (and very expensive compared to the average costs of life here); The most used transportation method is Tuk Tuks / Skylabs. The tricycle vehicle.

The main problem with Tuktuks is that they have **no** meters, so tourists need to negociate a price with the driver before starting their journey. Of course, as most tourists don't speak local language, and don't understand the ""normal"" prices for a given journey, drivers use this at their advantage to get paid 2, 3 or even 5 times the normal price.

**So, here's the idea:** **Buy out a couple of Skylabs to start out, redesign the vehicle to be attractive and all, INSTALL meters with cheaper prices than local taxis, and hire drivers. The idea being to save the tourists and locals the hastle of negociating prices and being treated as gold mines by the drivers.**

Tailor Service Business Idea,1,csry6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/csry6v/tailor_service_business_idea/,1,1566299322.0,"Hi All! I have an idea and would love to share it and get everyone's feedback. 

The idea is bringing a tailor service to office employees. I envision it working in cities like Chicago, NYC, San Fran (anywhere with dense office and high rise buildings).

The idea is that each week (or two) there would be a tailor representative on-site located in tenant amenity areas of an office building where tenants can bring items they need to be hemmed, fixed, etc. The tailor representative on-site will measure and mark, take their items, and return them directly to the tenant/customer the following week. Customers will be notified the service will be on site through a property management email blast and/or notified through an app.

On the back end, the on-site reps will then take the items to a local tailor/home-based tailor that will do the actual sewing. The following week, the items will be brought back to the office for drop off to the customer. This idea sparked due to being an office-based employee myself and needing a tailor, but was either too busy or too lazy to bring/pickup my items from the actual tailor. 

The entire concept is mainly centered around convenience to the customer, but think it has potential if executed properly and to scale. I think you could even grow it into traditional retail and partnering with online retailers. I have not put too much thought into the economics yet, but would obviously be a split between the actual tailor who sews items and the company which provides the service. It could also include shoe/bag repair. I would assume office buildings would allow us to use their tenant lounge for free as this would be an amenity to the building/tenants. Obviously quality control would be a huge thing. Thoughts? Any advice/ideas are greatly appreciated!",0

We basically screenshot the best and most important movie scenes, create a filter on Photoshop (with a graphic designer) which will turn the picture into a comic, modify it maybe a bit and add them all together in a comic book.

It's only for specific cities and dates and they don't give much notice (a month at most) but they'll even pay for the gas. The trips typically allow for a couple days on the road.

My idea would be to get 3 or 4 people from a particular city to sign up for this roadtrip. I would drive and offer feedback while not driving. We'd stop at some landmarks and startups along the way. I said in the title it's like Startup Weekend but it's actually a lot like a mini StartupBus if anyone is familiar with that.

We'd sleep in the RV so each person would only have to pay for meals wherever we stop and then the flight back to their home city. I'd also have to fly myself to the starting city but the RV rental and gas would be essentially free if I'm not mistaken.

Questions about this idea:

* Would I need additional insurance? Would some kind of standard commercial insurance work or is this weird enough that it would have to be a special policy?

* Would the RV rental company need to be informed about the commercial use of RV?

* How could I get several people in a particular city to commit to the trip with only a couple weeks notice?

I know things like OfferUp and Letgo exist which provides specificity of the product being sold on an online platform, but if people are still willing to do garage sales, then perhaps we can provide a service for these people. I think the number one problem is reach and awareness for people trying out old school garage sales. Maybe by creating a platform for people who are planning to do a garage sale can improve the chances of selling more stuff if they can be able let people from neighboring towns know as well? Looking forward to all your suggestions.",0

The main problem I’ve had is I want to pay someone back using Venmo or Apple Pay only to find out that person doesn’t have Venmo, they only have Cash App or PayPal. My main goal is to make a service that acts as a middle man and transfers a payment from one money service to a completely different one without having to wait to set up a new app and then wait again to transfer the money. It would work like this: I would use Company A’s app to pay my service that takes that money and then my service takes that money and would pay the person I want to pay back using Company B’s app. I think of it sort of as a translator for all the different money apps out there. 

I think the main issues would be finding a way to automate the payments in each of the many apps, and then just the actual task of transferring money between people to make it as a fast as possible. I think a fast transfer would require a large reserve of funds so my service wouldn’t have to wait for the transfer to go through.

Worst when you fronted the money and roommates are not very proactive about reimbursing you back. 

I have idea for payment wallet designed for households for paying shared expense.  Each roommate might deposit money into their own account as needed. When it’s time to pay for stuff, a member might request amount from the wallet. The wallet refills automatically,  withdrawing from each persons account as needed or on regular deposit. Think of it like Venmo requests, in sense that other roommates would need to approve any withdrawal.

Better yet if there was some kind of virtual credit card for the group wallet. It can used to pay for expense such as internet service and other subscription services, not tying them to any single person.

Urban Farming: production-rentability,3,cefhc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/cefhc2/urban_farming_productionrentability/,0,1563411154.0,"Hi guys,

Here in western Europe (also seems to be the case in the USA though) it looks like Urban Farming is having a hard time being profitable, especially when one is focusing solely on production. First solution that comes to mind is to diversify the sources of income, like organizing educational events or having a complementary catering business - I can't help but think that this doesn't solve the main problem: **how can we make the production profitable?**

&#x200B;

Making profit 101: *If gain > cost then profit*. That means we need to maximize gain and minimize cost. That being said, let's dive a bit deeper.

&#x200B;

What would be the cost of an average UrFa?

\- rent for space / location: I don't know outside of EU, but around here the closer to city center the place, the more expensive the rent. The obvious solution would be to settle on the periphery of the city but then it wouldn't really be a ""Urban"" farm anymore (we want it as much ""local"" as possible especially if you want to sell on-site). And transportation for the production would add up. Some startups decided to reclaim unused (and sometime unusual) places such as rooftops and (subterranean) parking lots, but then you are constrained by the place (rooftops in particular are not meant for large/heavy installations, not talking about people going back and forth with tools and vegetables) and can't really grow what you want.

\- building/tools/system: depending on whether you start a regular or off-ground farm and what you want to produce, you might have to invest quite a sum for the greenhouses, growing LEDS, sprinklers, pumps, aquaponic system etc. The more you automatize, the larger the investment ...

\- human labour: ... on the other hand, with more automation come less human labour. By selling ""on-site"" and on ""harvest it yourself"" mode, we can promote both the local and fresh aspect of the products while cutting down on the workforce. People and human interaction will always be needed  though.

\- electricity: amount will depends on which type of farm we run, but automation, aquaponics or exotic/unusual vegetables mean electricity for controlling the conditions (light, temperature, humidity...). Can be produced on-site with solar panel (and other ways) but it means more investment.

\- water: this one goes without saying, and it might be substantial if growing things that need a lot a water (cucumber, watermelons ...).

\- other material: such as seeds, fertilizer, fish food if aquaponics etc.

&#x200B;

Then, how could we cover the cost and hope to make a profit?

\- sell production: it's a no-brainer, but that's the whole point of the story. One way to maximize this would be to produce high margin vegetables or fruits (I'm thinking advocado, bell pepper or asparagus – which are kinda expensive here – instead of lettuce, tomatoes or carrots). If we are doing aquaponics, we'd sell fishes too.

\- sell by-products: not that I can think of much, maybe compost?

\- other activities: as said before, complementary activities to support the main activity of producing food.

&#x200B;

My take on this is that we are not thinking holistically enough. It's like a factory where you provide electricity/water/material in and (hopefully) get food and money out. IMO, it would be better to elaborate a system where multiple activities would be complementary to each other – an eco-system of sort.

For instance, instead of using electricity for heating the greenhouses, why not use it for something that produce heat as a by-product; e.g think about computers, sell the computing power or storage and use the heat generated for the greenhouses. Let's make a good use of these externalities !

&#x200B;

Okay thank you for reading so far. What do you think of this? Do you have any ideas about how to maximize profitability? What do you think of the computer example?",0

We would then present to users a platform that shows the following:

* live view of **what's the world watching and commenting on -** the user feels like they are plugging into a **visualized ""word of mouth""**
* content is sorted by emotions instead of traditional genres. So instead of picking an Action movie, the users can see what are some **""adrenaline-pumping""** movies that are also **""funny"".** We can do this as we have detailed sentiment analysis on each piece of content

Critique the hell out of this backup platform,8,c2v06i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/c2v06i/critique_the_hell_out_of_this_backup_platform/,8,1561059875.0,"Here's my idea.

Most of us probably use a jumble of cloud services. To-do list managers, accounting platforms, Gdrive, whatever.

If you're like me, you take backups seriously and want all your data in one place so that you can both keep a very thorough local backup and also mirror it somewhere else offsite / in the cloud.

**There are two problems with this, at least as I see it:**

1. Although these services take their own backups, and make them downloadable, doing so requires some level of reminding yourself to do it. Ie, doing a Google Takeout is well and good, but not so much if you need to initiate and download it manually.
2. Some cloud services still do not provide a backup / data export functionality in their UI.

My idea is to develop a service that would be kind of like the Zapier / Swiss army knife of cloud backups.

It would develop integrations with cloud services on a one-by-one basis and offer API-constructed backups so that users can access all their cloud-hosted data in one place and then move it from there to wherever they want it to go (whether that's a local server, S3, etc).

The use-cases target markets I'm envisioning:

* Enterprises with strict data governance policy, that need on-premises copies of all mission critical business data.
* Anybody else that wants to take, and store, really thorough backups.

Feasibility testing has thus far consisted of getting a couple of buddies, who are devs, to look over a couple of platforms' API documentation. They reckon that they can pull user data directly from that and compress it into an archive that could be used for service recovery.

Problem: There has been a lot of discrimination towards people who work in factories in terms of working conditions so much so that people have commit suicides. From an economics perspective, this is all driven by the demand or what we buy.  Companies will not stop these practices because it is all profit driven.

Now what if, just like google reviews, there was an app where people can rate how their working conditions are in their companies or their work practices.

Many people feel lonely today, see this [HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20116699&fbclid=IwAR2frbSI2zErBeAWC4d8TZ-qkZk677i3ZdBwuDliMkMCJLE8IQypqHvvwrU) about loneliness with > 1K comments. Moving to a new city and finding friends there is quite hard (this was the case for me my first year in nyc). 

I tried using BumbleBFF and the experience was far from ideal. The app not only did not take into account my interests, but it mostly showed me several pictures of potential friends. I don’t really care if my potential friend is good looking or not...It’s as if they took their dating app and just added BFF to the name, expecting this to help people make new friends.

I did some brainstorming with a friend and we think the ideal app/solution would be of the form: 

* The app shouldn’t focus on appearances: There should be at most 1 picture per user just to add some humanity to the users (sort of like how indiehackers does it). 
* Connections done in the app between people should focus mostly on interests in common
* Connections should be created for groups of 4-6 people. We think that too small a group (2 people) is putting too much pressure/stress on the participants, while 10+ people lack the intimacy of a smaller group.
* The app should encourage and incentivize ‘connected’ groups to meet in person -> Meeting virtually is not as intimate as meeting in person

Pricing as a Service,5,bznf7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bznf7m/pricing_as_a_service/,5,1560347903.0,"Over the past few weeks/months, I have been building a web product in my free time just to play around with some technologies. The product has limited space on the front page to post stuff and to post something you need to pay. 

Therefore you have the classic supply/demand issue when it comes to pricing. When there are no posts, it's cheap. When there are lots of posts, it's more expensive.

As a result, I am building reactive pricing into this app depending on how much supply there is on the front page. 

This got me thinking... I wonder if there is a market where a service could offer a nice dashboard where executives, decision makers, etc., could adjust prices on their sites easily. Additionally, I was thinking the api would offer a range of algorithms that could determine the pricing structure of the products on the end users site. Of course, the dashboard would show stats, competitors pricing, etc. for the decision makers to have all the data necessary to make a reasonable price decision for their product.

Dog shit P.I.

Yes. You read that correctly, dog shit private investigator. These guys are going to be your front line of surveillance for the lazy residents in your complex. Here of some FAQs to start you off:

**Q: Does your team handle any dog disposal?**

A: No. We are only on-premise to catch individuals in the act of not picking up after their animal and send that information directly to you, the apartment management team.

**Q: How can you prove the resident is at fault so we are able to fine them for the infraction?**

A: Our team will use photo or video evidence of the individual. We will catch them in the act and send all the information to you, the apartment management, team to take action.

Our goal here at **Shit Kickers P.I.™** is to provide your residents a poop free zone when they are walking around the premises. We have a few different packages available and these packages can be changed at any time as you will be on a month by month basis with our company.

Not only will we be the best whistleblowers money can buy, but you will also receive an initial supply of dog doo bags and FREE bags for as long as you are a customer. For your first month of service, we will clean, inspect and repair any waste bins on the property. These services will be available to you at any time however they will only be complimentary once every 12 months.

Packages: 

10 hours of patrol per month       **$1,100/month**

Food Startup Idea,10,bxx2xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bxx2xe/food_startup_idea/,12,1559956025.0,"I love eating good food. The best food I love in this world doesn't come from restaurants and can't be bought. It comes from family recipes (home cooking) and the food just tastes so much better than what can be bought.

My idea is to open a professional kitchen and let regular people come into the professional kitchen to make their family recipe foods in bulk. I feel cooking is a joy (past time) and I'm sure many people with free time would love to cook and ""show off"" their dishes and even make some money by selling it to the world. So attached to the professional kitchen, there would be a store, where we would be selling the food to the customers. That way, we can let the world taste these family recipes and have both the store owner and individual chefs benefit. 

Let me know what you guys think!

Disclaimer: I don't know anything about the food business and so will not be pursuing this myself. The above could be a bunch of nonsense - that's why I'm asking for your thoughts. But for me, I just really want to eat some ""family-secret"" recipes - I know this kind of food exists and cannot be found in restaurants (I have a specific dish myself that is loved by all!).",0

1. You create your profile (budget, availabilities for the month, choose interests from prepopulated list of activities)
2. Invite your good friends to create theirs
3. The bot automatically books an activity that fits into everyone's schedule, interest, and budget. It then sends everyone their invitation

* Person C owes $ 100 to Person A.

The debt will only be burned if all the people in the chain agree.

* Person B owes $ 70 to Person C.

Advice on Apprenticeships for Software Engineers,6,bvd5kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bvd5kz/advice_on_apprenticeships_for_software_engineers/,1,1559366907.0,"Hi r/Startup_Ideas! I've had this idea for a few weeks, and am doing research + speaking to people -- would love to hear thoughts and advice. 

TLDR: I want to create an apprenticeship program for self-learners, career switchers, and bootcamp students who are having a hard time landing a job/internship or struggling to get their first experience in software development.

&#x200B;

US citizens (1) are largely starting to question the point of 4-year college institutions (mostly because of student debt), and (2) are seeing a HUGE gap in the supply of engineers and demand of engineers (62K CS grads vs 500K engineering job openings). We all know that the best way for entrants to learn to be developers us to ""just do it"" - be immersed in the work and space or do your own projects.

From what I see, there has been a large movement of coding bootcamps to try and help people who want to become engineers. But from my experience and from friends that I talk to, the hard part isn't learning the concepts, it's actually learning through doing and then landing the first job/internship! Sure, some bootcamps probably help with this, but this after you drop a shitton of money, with the irony being learning these concepts currently can cost people 0 dollars (all the info is online!)

I'm proposing an apprenticeship program that is made up of (1) a “pre-course” training that includes a project - or series of projects for someone to build, (2) a few weeks of instruction to prepare students for an apprenticeship, focusing on what it is actually like to work on a TEAM of engineers and not necessarily on core engineering concepts, (3) matching students with an apprentice program for 4-12 weeks, and (4) mentorship throughout that time.

My thinking is that there are tons of firms that need engineering help (that's why there are 500k job openings!), make some money doing it, get experience you can showcase, and learn through doing. I call this an apprenticeship model because I want to bring the exiting concept of apprenticeships that tradespeople go through (carpenters, construction workers, plumbers, etc) to engineering.

Would this be useful for people? What are the first existing programs like this that you know about? What advice would you have?",0

The lead recommendation engine recommends similar companies to any user while he is prospecting, based on his preferences including industry, location, size, funding, etc. It employs continuous machine learning to understand what companies the user is looking for; once it gets the hang of it, it will show the user the companies he is likely to reach out to, batch after batch, in an almost endless stream.

Think of it like Amazon's or YouTube's recommendation system. However, instead of recommending books/videos, it does companies for marketing and sales people.

We've built a database with over 30 million companies, and we would build the engine base off of that.

Have you heard of any similar service/product out there? What do you think of this idea?

Without spilling details, I want to create a company that specializes in making a type of eyewear (cheap stuff, think like costume quality, not prescription glasses) and some related products. The market consists of a lot of companies producing the product in one variation. However, there are very few (like 4) companies producing the product in all its possible, and arguably more important, variations. I predict that as time goes on, the ""more important"" variations I spoke of will become more popular. The said companies that are producing these variations of it are selling them at *outrageously high* prices for how simple and cheap-quality their products are. Moreover, I've been looking into these companies and all but one of them has any substantial social media and online presence. Thus, for all these reasons, I feel like there's a lot of success to be had in this niche market, and I think the market will expand and currently CAN be expanded with the right online publicity.

This really marks the end of my knowledge. I don't know what role patents are going to play in this, if this is clear financial suicide, or really how to move forward from here. My thought is that a 3D model needs to be made and then sent to a manufacturer to get an estimated cost and prototypes. Then, I can begin testing the waters and selling. Again though, have no idea where patents fit into this (I know they're expensive as balls :( ). Can anyone lend me some guidance? I take brutal honesty as well.",0

However, where I'm from the police do not inform the owners where their vehicle could be located or even if whether their vehicle has been towed away in the first place. So most owners come back to a vacant space and go through a little panic attack wondering whether their vehicle was stolen or towed away.  

I want to create a service where vehicle owners whose vehicles have been towed away receive a message on their phone. The message let's them know of the charges against their vehicle, the location of the impound its at and the officer who oversaw it being towed away. There are a few ways I've thought of providing the service.   
1. It could either be a software based solution where vehicle owners sign up and link their mobile number and license no. to a vehicles registration no.  The app would have two versions one for users and one for police officers. The officers sign in with their service number, take a picture of the impounded vehicle and fill in the charges against it.  
2. It could be a product based solution, a gps device that placed in/on a vehicle let's owners know of its current location using an app again.

The problems:

1. The first solution can only work if the police dept and transport office agree on adopting and using this app.
2. The second wouldn't be incredibly accurate. Because commercially usable GPS services rarely are.  Also there will not be a verifiable source as in the first case where the overseeing officer could be questioned if a towed vehicle is missing. In short accountability is missing.

Revenue options:

1. Small charge from fine imposed on every vehicle is deducted around may be 2-4%. Advertising rights could be given to transport office or police in exchange for adopting app or used to generate further additional revenue. Sharing of database of mobile numbers and current users of registered vehicles with police and other govt agencies for investigative purposes.
2. Advertising on app.

I am hobby photographer, especially good at taking photos of Men. I can completely turn a normal guy upside down with my photos, from being a ""nobody"" to a guy a women would think ""wait hold up..  who is this guy?!"".

&#x200B;

well.. let me just say,.. I've done this for 6-7 friends now.. they all went from zero  to one tinder swipes to getting matches constantly. Those images changed their game of getting noticed.  I was so amazed by the difference, that I thought men really could need help in this area. I have other guys asking me to help them as well, So thought this could be an business idea instead of doing it for free. 

&#x200B;

Lets face it. Women do judge based of pictures, that is reality. (just as men do) but women get a ton of approaches.. and if you dont stand out.. you will get swiped out. Facts).  Women already have model-photos everywhere, why shouldn't an ordinary bloke show his best sides, his hobbies, his friends, what he has fun doing etc. 

&#x200B;

The problem is, men absolutely suck with portraying their best sides with photos. It's either the selfie gym pics or standing by a flashy car or a bland selfie with an iphone. these kind of images have low odds of working. Too cheasy and not enticing in any way for women to want to know such person. Please note these issues don't apply for handsome men. But for the normal guys, better pictures makes a ton of difference. 

&#x200B;

so, my idea is basically ;  I want to help men with photos that make them stand out,  so they can get noticed and get more dates on social sites.

&#x200B;

I want to portray the men at their very best, catching their smiles and laughs and let people see them with joy. I know how to do exactly this. I specialise in portraits with natural light and really good at finding locations that fits the guys personality. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Target : Men from 25+

&#x200B;

Getting customers: mouth to mouth, via tinder, marketing via fb-ig, having girls write to guys and direct to me.

&#x200B;

Price: ; $200 for a basic set of 5-6 edited images + more if need to change location or add girls into the pictures.

&#x200B;

Process: you sign up for a skype meeting on the site. We have a chat and I find out who you are and what you like. 

We meet up and I shoot pics of you in different scenarios. I select the ones I like, edit them and deliver results. 

&#x200B;

Here is an example of the quality of image I'd deliver : [https://500px.com/photo/250583959/two-basketball-players-playing-outdoor-in-la-by-cristian-negroni](https://500px.com/photo/250583959/two-basketball-players-playing-outdoor-in-la-by-cristian-negroni) . (this is not my picture, all rights reserved to christian negroni).

Great image of showing a hobby, they man having fun and enjoying himself. This is the kind of images that makes odds of getting swipes and responses increase very much. 

&#x200B;

or closeup images like ; [https://500px.com/photo/86762809/portrait-by-ram%C3%B3n-espelt?ctx\_page=2&from=search&ctx\_type=photos&ctx\_q=man+portrait](https://500px.com/photo/86762809/portrait-by-ram%C3%B3n-espelt?ctx_page=2&from=search&ctx_type=photos&ctx_q=man+portrait) . (rights reserverd to [Ramón Espelt](https://500px.com/Ronxoane))

&#x200B;

(no reason to post my own images for now and yes these guys look good etc. But I have skills to make similar for normal looking guys).  Naturally I cant guarantee if they will get dates, that is based on many factors such as how they write etc. But I can definitely help 10x fold their swipes with better images. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What do you think of the idea?

So here's a scenario for non travel agency seller, I live near establishments that are considered tourists spots.. I bought it in bulked so I got discount or got free tickets.. So i bought tickets then, sell it on the app, it depends on me how I would sell it, maybe I'll top it off with 30% of the price for me to make an income, etc.. So, just using the app, I can browse things I am intetested about, to travel, and I can also make money by myself.

My idea is to create 'corporate' or 'enterprise' accounts. A HR person can customize what speed is needed for pass/fail, and also they can customize the amount of chances an applicant gets.

After the initial setup, they just need to put in the applicant's email and the rest is handled for them. - I administer the tests, I have some filters set up to see if the applicant is trying to cheat the test, I record the scores, and can notify the HR person when the applicant is finished. And there is also a dashboard where the HR person can sort/filter through the applicants, give someone an extra chance to pass the test, archive old applicants, etc.

My biggest problem is that I haven't really done any market research - I do know that a lot of companies use 3rd party testing centers for this. I also know that a lot of companies send their applicants to the free section of my site (I've seen the job postings), and a few companies have required their applicants to get a $10 certificate from me as well.

We were working on a product called [tinyteam.io](https://tinyteam.io)  which was meant to be a collaboration tool for small teams that had a real-time chat component, a task manager, a decision making/discussion tool and a file sharing system. The overwhelming response was meh but a lot of them mentioned that they really liked the decision-making module. They were curious to understand how it worked.

  
So we're currently thinking of building a tool that aids teams in making complex decisions easier. Decision making is generally never easy, but it can be made easier by using structured processes. A journal helps the team look back on their decisions and improve their decision-making process. 

  
The general consensus with individual decision making is that a journal is really beneficial in providing feedback loops that allow you to become a much better decision maker.  But it doesn't seem like there is any tool for remote teams that helps with this process. Most resort to unstructured video calls that end up wasting a lot of people's time.

Selling points:

\- Much more affordable for young professionals that are very frugal or don't usually hang a lot at home  
\- Enable by-the-hour billing so people could use the pods during the day too  
\- Introduce variability in one's life due to sleeping in different areas and pods every night

I'm sure that this idea is not new, but as far as I can search, I didn't find out a nice product to achieve this. So I post my idea for discussion.

&#x200B;

Name: I’ll call it \[EasyForum\] in this article.

Many of us use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to host  comment services in our personal blogs, which can be very convenient to  introduce rich-text commenting system without the need of writing much  code. All you need to do is to register an account in Disqus and install  the widget into your website using a few lines of code. Later your  comments can be managed in a single dashboard.

What I propose to build is similar to Disqus, \[EasyForum\] is a  hosting service for forum services. I noticed that there are many  portfolio websites built for small/medium scale business like startup  brands, restaurants, or service providers. Some of them have the need to  set up a forum for their products’ users to discuss issues and help their customers solve problems. But it could cause some effort to build and  maintain a forum in their own websites and own servers, even if we use a forum software to do so.

&#x200B;

Expected feature list for the ‘embedding’ \[EasyForum\] service:

* the embedded forum can let visitors post and reply, and search
* visitors need to be registered as a user in \[EasyForum\] website, it  also allows 3rd party OAuth like Facebook, Google login, etc.
* admin can set the policy for content control, or avoid spam
* very simple to import into user’s website, as simple as import Google Analytics
* good performance on every platform
* complete admin control
* mobile-friendly, responsive design
* easy for users to change styles and suit their websites
* //TODO

&#x200B;

Question:

1. Is there already some products doing/tried to do so?
2. If not, why don't we have such product already? Possibly it could have many difficulties to implement a satisfying forum hosting service. Or it may not have many potential users as I expect.
3. Will there be many users? Forums definitely have some advantages when it comes to posting queries and sharing ideas, that’s why we can see self-built forums in nearly every website of big companies. But not sure for small/medium scale business, can \[EasyForum\] help them with their websites?
4. Difficulties? For now, most difficulties I can come up with are tech difficulties.

Does a new dating idea make sense?,12,bk64x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bk64x5/does_a_new_dating_idea_make_sense/,12,1556901586.0,"This is an idea of a dating app. Please, share here any thoughts, it is very important for me what you think about it.

&#x200B;

You may agree with me every day we see a lot of pretty nice people around.

Probably in the metro, on a bus station, gym or restaurant you see a pretty nice girl/boy. And if you are single, naturally at this moment you feel and want to come and approach the girl/boy.

But for some reasons like culture, fear of being rejected and timidity we don't do that, and this makes us feel terrible. 

As a result, we lose that girl/boy and the opportunity to be happy.

&#x200B;

Now image the solution when instead of people, mobile devices will do the work by approaching each other by scanning around through Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile network and looking for devices with the same app.

Each user installs the app on the mobile device, create a personal profile, set up search criteria(who he/she looking for) and the app do the rest. The app periodically scans around on the street, on the cafe, on the airport in clubs and everywhere.

When a device is founded, the user gets a notification on the app, and he/she can look at the found profile and send a request(like on LinkedIn) in case he/she would like. If the request is approved they can start chatting.

And here we go, we just make people happy. We just help them find the hole life love, or just one night sex, it depends on what both of them looking for.",0

Seeking Advice/Guidance,2,bjh5sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bjh5sv/seeking_adviceguidance/,7,1556746648.0,"Firstly, I hope this is the correct place to post this. If not, could someone please point me in the correct direction.

So, to begin, my name is Michael D. I live in a small country in South-western Africa called Namibia. We have an abundance of nature, and quite a few nature reserves to boot. But like much of Africa, we're lacking modern day solutions when it comes to monitoring these reserves.

All of this is still theoretical, I'm simply asking for advice so that I may, maybe, one day turn this into a reality.

Imagine being able to monitor your favourite reserve from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an active internet connection. Not only for tourists, but for the game rangers as well. To allow them to see more of the park at once, instead of what they see when they drive around.

We have both state owned and privately owned reserves, which will be approached differently but the core concepts remain the same.

Because many of the reserves are in remote areas with a lot of wildlife roaming around, installing cables for all the monitoring seems a bit unlikely. However, having wireless cameras with longe range repeaters seems a bit more likely. 

As far as the power source for the cameras are concerned, small solar panels with batteries seem to be my only option to support the whole wireless idea.

I'd like there to be an app and a website for viewing the cameras, but have no idea which to do first, or even how to do one of them.

The finer details, like the web and app details or the technical specifications, are not really a big concern for me at the moment.

I'm simply looking for someone that can point me in the correct direction/directions so that I can find out if this can be made a reality, or if it'd be better if I leave this as a dream.

Thank you for your time and consideration.",0

I know that if a company pays an individual $600 or more, then they must issue a 1099. But I've also heard that if the payment is made to an intermediary (such as Paypal, CashApp, etc), then they no longer need to worry about the reporting, that it becomes the intermediaries responsibility to report.

Is that correct?

An underwater second condo in form of a container.,2,bifvu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bifvu2/an_underwater_second_condo_in_form_of_a_container/,4,1556513444.0,"So the real estate near rivers and bodies of water is often unbelievably expensive and the space is full. So say would want to spend a few hours in private near one of the bodies of waters; you get an underwater (sealed obviously) container that has rechargeable lights, a bed, a couch, desk, computer etc. The containers can't fill the whole river, but at the edges where no boats go having them down there shouldn't cause ecological/business issues.

Why would people want a secondary condo. For one, people often live far from the heart of city activity. Often bodies of water are much closer to the heart of city activity. Having your own secondary private space would come in handy and let you spend more time near the heart of activity.

Secondly, a home is a person’s sanctuary but it can become dull and personal space can become limited if you have lots of family members living with you. Spending a few hours on a Sunday afternoon at your nice quiet underwater condo can let you recharge your batteries so that you are more invigorated while at actual home. 

One would have to engineer a bit to make a way for the person to get in without getting completely wet, but other than that the costs shouldn't be high. This would be contingent on a deal with the city, that they get big part of the rent as tax compensation for supporting an innovation.

I have a small business idea that keeps popping  in my mind daily and i would really like to hear your opinions and advices about this. 

The main idea is to revive a old comunist wristwatch brand that is no long manufactured. Being from a eastern former communist country i noticed that old and young people are very sentimental towards old brands brought back to life in the capitalism era. 

I researched manufacturing options and found that the most convenient options are: to buy the parts from china and assemble the watch here or to contract a Chinese manufacturer (from Alibaba/Aliexpress/GearBest) and have them shipped. The only problem with manufacturers in china is that most will not send a small number of products for quality check and demand a first order of 500+ pieces.

As for the design/dials/logos i thought of using sites like Fiverr until i can make enough money to hire a design and marketing person. 

This is a short version of what i want to build. 
What are you thoughts? 
Would it work? 
What are the main criteria that would convince you to buy a wristwatch? 
Do you have any other ideas regarding manufacturing, packaging, suppliers?

So I think it'd be a good idea to buy earphones custom made to my ears (like snugs.com), but they are too expensive for my entertainment purposes.

As I am studying my degree in computer vision, I think I can take a video of my ears (like moving my camera around to see my ears in different views), then create a 3d model of it, and then create my very own ear phones that will never fall off again.

I'm quite positive I'll be able to do it, but when it comes to turning my personal need into a startup, I would like to hear what you guys think about this so I can know beforehand what I might have missed, thank you!

Public version of product roadmaps where users can upvote and downvote,3,bccauq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bccauq/public_version_of_product_roadmaps_where_users/,12,1555096299.0,"**Background:**

I work in the enterprise space, and its hard to figure out what the vast majority of customers want. 

**Idea:**

1. Do you guys see value in having a online space where users can request for certain features.  Now other users can see those feature requests and up-vote or down-vote them?
2. If we want to give private access to existing customers only, then keep the product under secured accounts that are only given to customers.

**Advantages:**

As a engineering/product/product management group, we now have a top list of features that we should attack.",0
Short term loan app,9,bbjfqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bbjfqu/short_term_loan_app/,14,1554912390.0," There  are a couple of apps slowly coming onto the market for solving the  ""payday"" loan issue of sub-prime candidates needing quick cash. They all  approach the issue in a similar way by evaluating individual  backgrounds and credit scores and taking the risk in loaning them cash  from an account, then charging interest.

My idea is to have a platform  where you can connect people who need a short term loan with folks  willing to help crowdfund that loan. Users would post their story of why  they need the loan and the total amount they need (similar to GoFundMe)  and would crowd-source the funds with other users who empathize with  their situation.   Each new user would have a limit, probably around $250, that they can  ask for. We can incentivize lending money to other users and paying the  funds back by increasing this total limit, thereby creating social  credit on the platform. For example if a user pays back their original  $250 loan the total amount they can ask for increases to $300. If a user  lends another user $20, the total loan amount they can ask for in the  future would go up to $270.

The transactions could possibly be  done through  Venmo and could charge a %5 transaction fee before lending  total amount to the user. There will most likely be a lot of ""bad  actors"" initially, so every account would require maybe a phone number  upon sign-up. Overtime anyone who hasn't paid back their loan will be  banned, and users will be able to rate other users to have better  transparency on who is using the platform appropriately.

Other similar ideas I've seen trying to approach this issue are LendUp, Kiva, LendingClub, Earnin, GoFundMe etc.",0

Summer storage for University Students?,9,bb7tig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/bb7tig/summer_storage_for_university_students/,8,1554844582.0,"There are a few valet storage concepts around so there appears to be demand for the **""drop off a box, I fill it, you haul it and store it""** model.  

A point of differentiation for this model would be to use existing storage space that is underutilized. Homeowners with empty basements/rooms during the summer season could be paid a small price/box to safely store the boxes which eliminates the need to build a large centralized storage facility.

Most University students drop off their stuff in May and don't need it again until Aug/Sept.

Security of the boxes would be an issue so we'd have to ziptie the boxes with a barcoded zip or something.  Insuring the items would also be an issue.  

Customer pays $8/large bin/month for storage.  
Host gets $4/box/mth

For example, my basement could easily hold 100 boxes (probably 300 if it was really full).   $400/mth = $1200 and it's less invasive than AirBnB, etc.",0

This could be a big business opportunity. How many city is willing to pay you not to bus in or bus by? How many city is willing to pay you to bus out?

I do not pretend to know what is the best for other people(including homeless people), because I have a hard time to decide what is the best for me and my family. So I like to offer people choices(w/ free will). If the city(cities) are happy to pay is even much better.

Under no circumstance that people is forced to take this deal. All people acts on their own free will.

1. ask for donation
2. decide a destination which is difficult to return and has big cities near by(for example Reno, easy to migrate to SF or Sacramento or Bay Areas)
3. hire buses
4. Free one way bus to Reno. While riding, some free weed/food/water for enjoyment.
5. Get off Reno, we will give you a small package of weed for couple days of enjoyment. We also will give you a piece of paper promising(like politicians's promises) you one year free weed at specified location.

Is There a Market For Home Archives/Digitization?,1,b9b3uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/b9b3uq/is_there_a_market_for_home_archivesdigitization/,0,1554403110.0,"Every family has thousands of old photos, hours of home videos, and pages to fill volumes of aging records. Old mixtapes, high school love letters, ancestry records and correspondences, and video tapes from years past are aging, and often become illegibly damaged, rotting away from neglect when they are forgotten in a humid attic for decades.

We would offer archival and preservation services, being able to make digital records of your home photographs, video and audio tapes, and any documents that you want, such as diaries or letters, engineering or legal documents, and high-quality captures of original art pieces.

In addition to regular archives, we would be able to handle fragile or sensitive documents that are liable to be damaged through normal handling, such as waterdamaged papers or photo albums that can't be put through a traditional scanner, and offer no-contact imaging through high-quality camera setups to ensure that the originals are preserved. 

We could also offer transcription services for both recorded and written media, offering subtitles and text copies from audio recordings, as well transcribing handwritten notes into text documents, or altering hand-filled forms to a digital font.

Eventually I would like to also offer some level of organization services - like have a system able to scan and identify and tag similar faces, locations, etc, as well as offer maintenance restoration services for damaged videos and documents.

Clients would then be able to receive their new digital archives however they want, via burned to a CD or USB drive, or just transferred over the Internet, as well as obviously get their originals back.

&#x200B;

While I would be able to take mail-in orders, as most archiving businesses seem to do, I am hoping to focus on a general local area, having a place where people can drop off and pick your documents in person. The biggest issue I can think of getting clients would be the cost; the process in extremely time consuming, which is why I'm kind of hoping people would be willing to hire someone else to handle it. While I haven't really figured out a pricing model yet, I want to offer more or less a flat rate, but I was thinking setting the rates to be about equivalent 50 to 60 dollars an hour for most services. Roughly, that would give me a pricing model of something like 25 to 50 cents for an average photograph, depending on how big they are, and a couple cents each for less detailed documents that don't require editing or transcribing, and probably about 40 dollars for transferring an average video cassette. For really large things, like big maps or something, or doing captures in extreme detail, it would probably be about 10 to 20 dollars per piece. Another model I was thinking about was doing something incremental - like up to 100 photos for 50 dollars or something, up to 200 for 95, etc, rather than pricing it by each.

I'm curious if anyone has any experience with such a service, perhaps some ideas as to how to improve the concept or viability, or is at least would be interesting in hiring someone to do this?",0

However, our website will be different.

So what are the services we will be providing?

* Code fixing: 
   * You are learning how to code, following courses, tutorials and everything is great. Then..bam! An error. You spend few hours googling the problem, trying few solutions, rewriting code... only to find out that it was a simple error, that you could have avoided.
   * With us you will skip all of the aforementioned tasks by posting your problem with a monetary incentive for expert programmers to help you. Not only they will fix it but they will also have to show you how they did it, what they used, and why they used it. And all of this is for you to keep so no worries about getting stuck again!
* Coaching:
   * After finishing your courses, and reading few books you feel like you are ready to start a new project by your own. However, you feel like there are some concepts that you did not fully grasp when you were learning.
   * Post your project on our website and look for a coach/mentor who will help you along the way or whenever you feel stuck or unmotivated. These coaches will be paid by the hour, when ever they initiate a session. You can pick whether they can review your code once a week, every couple of days, or even monthly!
* \*future feature\* one-on-one courses/Project Based Learning.
   * Doing it on your own can be pretty boring. Learning from an already designed course for a project you do not want to build is even more boring. Learn coding the way you want it! Think about any project you have in mind, and learn how to make it with our experts! They will tell you exactly what to learn, and help you every step of the way.

&#x200B;

What are the pros and cons of creating such a service?

* Pros:
   * More inviting platform as people will be earning money
   * Those who are more time restricted will be more willing to learn programming and sticking with it
   * Creating a new market for Programmers.
   * Database of problems and solutions for everyone to see.
* Cons:
   * People might refuse to help others for free anymore.
   * Less fortunate people who want to learn will be hurt the most from a service like this.
   * People might use it as solve my homework or do my job for me service.
   * You might learn less as you will not spend time looking for answers, learning on your own...etc

&#x200B;

Problems & Solutions?

* People might abuse the system by picking an answer they themselves submitted after stealing someone else solution to get their money back.
   * We will handle this by locking the money away as soon as someone posts a valid solution. 
* You as an expert picked a problem, you worked on the solution, only to find out someone else has posted a solution before you!
   * Before picking a problem you can see how many people are working on it. Every expert can only have X problems at a time. If there is too much competition it is better to steer away. 
   * In addition original poster can split the reward money two way between two posters.
* You created a post only to find out you have figured it out before an expert, and now you want your money back!
   * No worries, we will refund you the money back to the website wallet or bank account. However, this can only be done if an expert has not posted a solution. If they did post a solution then you can only refund 75% of the reward money.
* Less fortunate people who want to learn will be hurt the most from a service like this.
   * All the questions asked and answers will be free to view for everyone. Unless, the original poster requested the answer to be private. However, original poster has to pay a fee to keep the answer hidden or removed.

Companies generally not aware of new trends + events worldwide. They only stick a few of them. As a result of that, employees must pick from a very small number of choices.

\- Employee can pick multiple choices with priority

An idea for affordable furniture and appliances for college students,2,b5e2pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/b5e2pm/an_idea_for_affordable_furniture_and_appliances/,5,1553565803.0,"Hey, 

I have been thinking about this idea for a while but I finally need to decide whether to pursue the idea or not. The idea is fairly simple: buy furniture (and things like TVs, microwaves, and printer) on sales from stores or in good condition from places like craigslist and Facebook and rent it to college students for affordable prices. The competitors in my area don't offer affordable options, the lowest one I found was for a bed and a nightstand and it was $99 a month. At this price point no college student would spend that much monthly because after a year it just makes more sense to buy the furniture yourself for less than $1,200. I think I can bring down the price a lot by using a security deposit. Students puts down a deposit, pay a small monthly fee maybe somewhere between $20-80 per piece or set, and when the rental period is done the deposit is returned if the rental is returned in a ""reasonable"" condition. My target market would be students living in off campus housing and foreign exchange student.  If this existed during my time in school I would definitely have been willing to pay $200 per semester or $400 for the year to have nice furniture especially if I didn't have to worry about moving it or what to do with it afterwards. I think the deposit really allows the prices to be substantially lower and make it more affordable than the competitors. 

Please let me know what you think.  ",0

A wish machine...,2,b3af4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/b3af4k/a_wish_machine/,5,1553106978.0," 

Hello everyone ! Me and my wife were thinking about an idea to create a system or machine to help anyone make small wishes come true. When I say small wishes, I mean its limited to any type of items from an online store (except harmful items like alcohol, tobacco etc.).

How would this system work ?

\- To put this in practice, we would build up a crowdfunding website similar to kickstarter but in our case it would be about what items people want, not what businesses they want to get backed on.

\- To be able to use this machine you have to help someone else first, support him/her with a minimum of 1$. (Think of a wishing well, you have to toss a coin then wish for something)

\- When you become eligible to post a wish (by supporting someone else first) you will paste a link to the item from the store and then you will describe why do you need that item, how this item would help you, videos, pictures, any means to help you get support (some content will not be acceptable as per system's policy, i.e. sexual, emotional blackmail or threats, vulgarity, etc.)

\- You get 1 wish/month, starting from the day you ""made a wish"". If you didn't get enough support from others and did not reach your target (the amount of money you need for that item you wish), all supporters will have their money returned to them and you will have the possibility to wish again on the same item or something else.

\- If the item from the store becomes unavailable, the system will notify you and you will have the option to cancel your wish or replace with another item that costs the same or less then your initial target.

\- We will make use of a ranking system to help you promote your wish. This means, the higher your rank gets the better your wish posts are visible or among the top of the list. To make it fair for everyone, new wishes will be promoted for a day or two on the top page.

\- To improve your rank you have to be active in this community. You will get points for supporting others, refer others (help the system increase it's community), how many times you visit the system / day / week. Post videos or photos that proves you did good deeds in the society (helping a homeless person, cleaning up environments, giving good advice to those in need, etc.) and other ways to go....

\- The machine will have it's slice of the pie (i.e some small percentage of the sums achieved for fulfilled wishes). These funds will be used to continuously improve the system, increase the community, give prizes, create success stories, and if these will become substantially big the system will make charitable donations to non-profit organizations.

Of course it's not everything we've thought about, but this is the big picture. The risks about this idea is how people understand it. Some may think it's an online begging platform, charity, some kind of pyramidal referral system, distrusting, or just a scam idea that can't be true. The truth is, none of these would describe this system if people would understand how it works and just try it.

**Why?**

I have been talking to many other founders and one of our problems is:

People focus on trying to find ideas too much. But problems are more important, if you solve a problem you can build a business out of it. Unfortunately most developers don't really see the problems in an industry, niche or field of work.

Custom Meal Plan,1,b2kxfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/b2kxfs/custom_meal_plan/,3,1552956131.0,"Hi guys, 

I am living in a dorm with 5,000 students and had the idea of creating a website which people can create their own meal plans depending on their nutritional goals (e.g. bulking, shredding, general well-being, etc) and I supply them door-to-door with food and supplements based on their needs. My friend is a nutrition-science major and a bodybuilder who will help me create the meal plans and decide on which carbs,proteins,fats to include to each meal. The meals won't be cooked by me, but rather be me buying pre-cooked chicken breast, etc in bulk and putting them into each meal box. Think of a blue apron but for uni students who only have access to a microwave and want to eat food that will help them achieve their aesthete. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but here in Korea there are lots of pre-cooked packets of rice, noodles, chicken breast, eggs, you name it. 

&#x200B;

So why would they use my service? During my 4 years living in the dorms I've seen countless packages of frozen chicken breast being thrown away as students buy too many / cannot portion it properly / get bored of the same taste. My service would allow me to purchase in bulk a variety of foods in which customers and mix and match into their meal plans, being delivered into microwave safe containers in which all they have to do is heat up and eat. 

&#x200B;

Another thing I would do is buy protein, pre-workout in bulk and portion it into little sachets, allowing customers to mix and match the supplements they want without the fear of buying a whole tub and not liking it. 

&#x200B;

The payment methods are weekly, monthly and semester basis. Semester basis would give customers a bigger discount than the weekly plans. 

&#x200B;

I would really appreciate if you guys gave me any ideas on the pricing model (i.e. keep the base rate the same, have a low,med,high/vip subscription plan, add supplements as packages, etc.) or any other comments about the idea as well.

Only starters and young professionals can sign up, so they will not be compared to people with (way) more years of experience. Instead of that, they are compared to each other and companies maybe will look further then only hard skills. They will see people aged 25 can't have 26 years of experience. In my opinion, it's all about the will. The will to learn, the will to develop yourself. Soft skills are so underrated. It's important to find the right kind of person for a job. A lot of developer Jobs ask for different kind of persons then sales Jobs and i'd like to use the DISC-method for this part. 

It's still just a basic idea. Had some positive reactions in my region (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Curious how you all look at this idea. Feedback, tips, ideas; just leave it below!!

I had an idea on a drive home and I reached out to a friend of mine who has intimate knowledge of the problem. The idea involves organizing and keep track of medical/doctor visits, insurance claims, and payments, all (hopefully) without wandering into the shit-storm known as HIPPA.

The problem is...I can't find a single company/competitor doing this or anything similar, which unnerves me. That tells me that:

1. There is no money to be made in this space. No one is going to pay for something to help organize, understand, and use insider knowledge to get the most of our their insurance.
2. Companies won't go near this problem because of HIPPA. I've yet to really look into that aspect yet, but from what my knowledgable friend says, HIPPA won't be an issue given how we are approaching it.

Is there something I'm missing? My friend and I are going to be reaching out to our circle of contacts to see if the idea carries any weight. I suppose if we get interested people that should be good enough, right?",0

With the goal of becoming a quick and efficient app or site, I would start out locally connecting at first soccer players to coaches on existing sites through my site and google form.

medical consulting app,8,azdfp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/azdfp5/medical_consulting_app/,12,1552232009.0,"Dear friends, need your opinion regarding below given idea. 

Imagine your have some kind of pain, or some concern about your healthiness, when you dig google you are ending up with ""cancer"".  I mean, even if you're trying to learn about small problem it is hard to get answer from internet.  So imagine, an app where doctors, or almost graduate medical students has been registered, and by category you can enter to app and ask for your problems. For the first 15 min (or whatever is that) consulting is free, and the doctor might help you regarding your issue ""whether is it very serious, you should see the doctor asap, or might be small problem which is not quite dangerously serious."" 

&#x200B;

The reason, for app, to avoid misleading from internet, such as fb groups, or some medical forums, and etc. And a rating system should be applied for the consulting doctors, to make comparative environment and motivate the doctors, to do their best. And that rating can play a role about their consulting fee after free 15 min.   


So basically my first question is: Whether this kind of app exists or not ?   
If not: what might be pros and cons?   
Earning money; as of first option advertisements come to my mind, but if the app spread than it will be much easier to earn money.

Vending machine refill company,3,azap4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/azap4m/vending_machine_refill_company/,5,1552210556.0,"Okay, so, I'm 100% sure a company like this exists, but since they're not very advertised in comparison to the massive market demand, here it is:

The idea is a company who would go around and refill vending machines for cheap. 

What you would basicallly need is a cold storage area somewhere along with refrigerated trucks and then you would hire people to go around and fill the machines. Easy.

You would buy the products in bulk aswell (coke, water, etc) to save on money, then sell the refill order (everything you just refilled) to the machine owners themselves. Not only would you be making money, but the machine owners would likely have the incentive to expand their network of machines (cause passive income), making you more money on the way. It's a win-win.

One big plus side to this idea which I find isn't very common on this sub, is the possibility to start this business with nothing but a fridge, a cooler, and a car (hell, you could even bike). I can see how it would be pretty realistic to make between 10-20$ per machine refill. If you hit say 15 machines in a work day, that's 150-300$. Not to mention, you would be refilling nearly every day at popular vending machines. Not too shabby if you ask me.

Solution: A guide service where it present you all guides and services local to you.  Such as entertainment guides, newspapers, TV and radio stations, community directories, promotional/marketing associations (like chamber of commerce, visitors assoc, etc.).

How it works:  People wanting to have thier resource listed enter thier name, URL and the ""service are"" via a google maps polygon or something like that.  Public search by city, county, etc are match by a gps coordinate that lands within the database of resource areas.  Could be easily implemented as a mobile web app.

Unpaid listings just get their name, URL and categories.

Paid listings subscription would get a front page tile-able display ad, and depending on service-area rates vary (state, national, world would be most expensive), paid listings tile on the result and the unpaid are presented on a subsequent list.

Foodie app idea,4,az33fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/az33fq/foodie_app_idea/,2,1552163911.0,"Hey guys,  
I am working on a software project and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

**Idea**  
It is an app for groups visiting restaurants to split their bills. The idea is to connect to the restaurant sales system where the orders are stored - this way orders can be matched to customers, so that they can access the order on their mobile phone and find out how much they have to pay and what exactly they ordered.

**Current solutions**  
I am aware and a big fan of other bill-splitting apps such as Splitwise. However, the issue with these is you need to manually put all expenses into the app - with my solution you wouldn't need to do that.

**Advantages for the customer**

* you see what you ordered - no way to trick you,
* easy to find out how much you need to pay (we all had a pleasure to count how much to pay when having a dinner with a bunch of friends)

**Advantages for the restaurant**

* attracting more clients through transparency and ease of splitting,
* offloading waiters,
* possible statistical customer analysis

Natural consequence is to allow payments through the app - do you think it's a valuable addition? Do you think it's worth it without payments?

"Why are companies not utilizing the ""show less of [x, y, z]"" button more?",2,ayxpd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ayxpd6/why_are_companies_not_utilizing_the_show_less_of/,5,1552121325.0,"For the past few years, increasing polarization of the left-wing (e.g., blasting Trump) and right-wing politics (e.g., slamming Sanders) made me want to stay from the news altogether, at least while I am using the internet or Youtube.

I found Instagram's ""show \[x, y, z\] less"" button very handy. I tried to actively block political news out from my Instagram feed and only show business news or only read about political news from business newspapers.

**Then I started to wonder why aren't internet service providers (e.g., Google) or online stores (e.g., Amazon or Nordstrom) utilizing the ""show less of x, y, z"" button more.**

As far as I know, collecting consumer data is the key to effective marketing, and many internet service providers are selling such user datas to 3rd parties. Such companies have marketed their products based on what the consumers like, e.g., based on their search or purchase history. But I think equally useful will be learning about their **lack of interests or dislikes**. I remember my experience of trying to buy a pair of pants but could not ""filter out"" cargo pants I was just not interested in. Of course Google does provide ""-\[\*\]"" function to narrow down their search but it is not permanent and does not affect individual outcomes of the search.

Is there any explanation for why such companies are not utilizing the ""show less of \[x, y, z\]"" function? Is it because they are nevertheless trying to charge AD fees or sell unpopular brands?

I do not know whether it is technically possible, but I am wondering why there isn't a startup company that provides Google extensions or internet platforms (something like internet explorer) that specializes in this function.

P.S. Apologies if such idea already exists. I do not have industry expertise, and after the startup boom, probably almost all the ""good ideas"" have probably been exploited by MBA students and future entrepreneurs. Posting this as a question or in a wish to engage in a thought experiment.",0

This is something that has negatively impacted every college student and graduate in the U.S. Many students are resorting to sharing textbooks, buying them used, rentals, digital options, or simply just not buying it all and hoping for the best. But often times the used textbook route isn't an option because a class requires the newest edition, or extra software codes for homework, and even when a textbook is shared or bought used there had to be an original buyer who did purchase it new at full price. Because of this textbook publishers are also [suffering](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185042/us-publishing-revenue-from-textbooks-since-2005/).

It will function basically as a digital textbook rental service. But it will be a bundle that includes each individual students material for the classes they are specifically taking. Implementation includes possibly making this a requirement in schools that participate (to access a students class info), but making it a cheaper route than buying each textbook new. Our bargaining power with the textbook publishers will be research to support students are buying less new textbooks, and profits have decreased and are projected to decrease more. Students and teachers alike are unsatisfied. And Colleges have the [resources to completely avoid the big publishers](https://www.leadwinds.com/the-comprehensive-guide-to-college-textbook-trends/) in my opinion.

However, I offer the service at a lower price (Bite offers the service at $150 for two customized lipsticks before tax). Also, I have my channel to provide the organic ingredients and the smell essence needed to create the unique smell for the lipstick. The operation of the machine to make the lipstick requires no license. Which means that everyone can literally make the lipstick by operate the machine under supervision.

Also, the current communication method most elementary schools use is through wechat groups, however, it lacks the need of privacy of individual students. Teachers are more likely to make decisions only on a macro perspective. Some parents may also feel reluctant to speak publicly in the group. The goal for yoyo is to facilitate students flourishing.

For the Homeowners, the company will insure every pet against damages, so they can rest easy knowing that someone will pay for anything that happens.

Tiny Teams | Minimum Viable Collaboration,3,aw2lvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/aw2lvk/tiny_teams_minimum_viable_collaboration/,0,1551458648.0,"Hello Reddit,

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of building a tool for teams. Here is my problem, and the solution I thought of.

&#x200B;

**Problem**

I'm working with a friend of mine to build an accounting app. We used slack for general discussions, Email for weekly updates, Loomio for team decisions, Trello for keeping track of who is doing what, I used used workflowy to organise my own todos, zoom for meetings, google calendar to schedule the meetings, I think there are a few more but you get where I am going.

&#x200B;

Keeping track of all of the different notifications got a bit ridiculous and things started slipping through the cracks so we eventually switched to Basecamp. Which is fantastic. But it's overkill for such a small team (2 of us were core team and another 2 people that help out now and then). Only four of their modules were active at the peak of it.

&#x200B;

My problem is that if I want to get anything done with someone online I have to employ a small army of apps to keep track of things.

&#x200B;

**Solution**

Create a one page solution that has the fewest number of features needed for a group of people to implement an idea together.

&#x200B;

After much ado we settled on the following 4 components:

1. A real time discussion module
2. An asynchronous decision module
3. A Tasks module
4. A module for Static documents

&#x200B;

The key thing is that they all exist on one page. One page to chat, make decisions,  get stuff done and upload the results. Everyone on the team can see what is going on.

&#x200B;

I left a rationale for settling on these four components below. I'd love to know what you think. Can we remove one of them? Should there be more?

&#x200B;

**Please upvote if you think this sounds useful or leave a comment if there are things you would change. We will the use the feedback to get a sense of whether or not its worth building.**

&#x200B;

\###

&#x200B;

Rationale for each component:

1. **A real time discussion module**. I hate slack. I hate the constant interruptions. I hate that important stuff gets lost in the noise. But I acknowledge that chats are important. If you have a quick question about something or if you're all online at the same time, you don't need to start an email chain. In my opinion chat is good as long as it now where the important stuff happens. To hammer this point home we only store the last 100 messages in our chat module. That way there's never too much to catch up on, but always enough to understand the context of what's being discussed. If something important happens in chat you move it to an asynchronous discussion.
2. **An asynchronous decision module**. This is a lot like chat but it's not a streaming feed of general thought, discussions are focused around specific topics. If someone raises a good point in chat, you can turn it into a decision. Decisions live in a separate module, everyone can see what the current important group decisions are. You can read through the discussion on a decision and contribute to it in your own time. The only rule is that a decision must have options that people can vote on and the decision must be concluded by a certain date. So, ""should we do x"" could be a decision where ""Yes/No"" are the options, and the deadline is a week from today. The wording of a decision can evolve as the discussion around it unfolds and people can add options (Yes/No/ Yes, but only if Y). People can change their votes as many times as they want before the deadline, and they can extend the deadline, but once a decision is made it must be converted into at least one task.
3. **Tasks**. This module is just lists of tasks. You can assign tasks to people,  set deadlines and mark them complete. Shows everyone who is working on what and what needs to be done.
4. **Static documents.** The header of this one page page would be a 500 word summary of what the project is about to help orientate new people. A collection of important project links, and a space where you can upload important documents. These documents are the things your team is producing. So if your team was setup to create a policy document, this is where drafts of the document go.  If you are making a website, then you link to it in the important links. Basically, the fruits of all your labour.

&#x200B;

The two main module that we discarded were **Video Calls** and a **Calendar**.

We decided not to go with either because the effort-to-reward ratio wasn't high enough. Video calls are important but they also waste a lot of time if you don't have a clear agenda set. They are also expensive, a 3 person 1-hour meeting costs the project 3 hours. They are also tricky to set up if everyone is in different timezones. If a video call once a week is important to your team then just add a zoom link to the important links section.

Calendars are notoriously hard to build and we're not sure how important they are. We do have deadlines in the app for tasks and decisions. Maybe it would just be wiser to create an 'add to your calendar' link to things if you want to keep track of them on your own calendar. I acknowledge they are important but ultimately we decided that they weren't important enough. I'd love to hear the counter argument though.

1. If you go to the hot pot restaurant, there are always so people and the dining environment is too noisy. When the customer needs a waiter, there may be no waiter around or when you call them for help they might not hear you. 

2. Everyone has a different eating preference. Some are meat lovers, some love veggies, some love spicy hot pot soup base, or some love non-spicy. So, it takes a long time to figure out what kind of soup base and dishes to order. 

3. The waiter may not have time to take the empty plates in time. The empty plates for the dishes take too much space. 

4. Order too many foods might cause food waste problem.

&#x200B;

Solution:

I want to open a conveyor belt hot pot restaurant. One person, one pot, you could choose your favorite hot pot soup base to be spicy or non-spicy. For vegetarian, you could ask our server to help you get a vegetarian soup base. The price is fixed at $24.99, all you can eat, with 2 hours limited eating time. We provide an endless amount of food, drinks, dipping sauces and desserts. The customer could order alcoholic or other drinks, but you need to pay extra money on it and those beverages are not included. The dishes in the hot pot are like rotating sushi, placed on a conveyor belt within a small box, and guests can take the dishes according to their own preferences. The empty box can be placed on the high platform next to the conveyor belt. Our service area in the middle will have the waiter to take the empty box in time. But once the dish is taken by the customer, it can no longer be put back to the conveyor.

Once the delivery is done, they send a password via text message or E-mail to the package owner who can use this password to open the box afterwards. Delivery person opens the box also by a special password. All the passwords should be manged by this third-party company by an APP. Package owners can do all the tracking via this APP.

Startup Ideas-Mobile car buffing and waxing business,1,av3ews,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/av3ews/startup_ideasmobile_car_buffing_and_waxing/,1,1551238018.0,"The Problem: The increasing usage of technology has eased the way business is done and revolutionized traditional industries such as transport and automotive repairs. One of the most pressing issue facing vehicle owners is the regular scratching of their cars especially in parking lots, squeezed spaces, traffic, and even at home by young children. In most cases, vehicle owners may lack the time to give attention to such tiny scratches and in the long-term, the vehicle appears older than it should. Besides, visiting a garage is time-consuming and at the same time costly since most garages charge hefty fees for the removal of the tiny scratches.

The Solution: Taking the service needed by the vehicle owners close to them would make them feel satisfied as they get to supervise the entire process at their own convenience and without consuming the time to visit the garages. In this case, we propose a mobile car buffing and waxing business that will be majorly supported by a mobile app. We consider this solution the “Uber” of car waxing and buffing where we recruit localized experts on a subscription and commission basis. This means that by turning their apps on, customers will be matched to the nearest available expert. On the other hand, customers will have an opportunity to rate the service of the experts and also a chance to be assigned to a preferred expert.

Hi all! I’ve been working for 5 years in banking, concretely, with the supervisory stress tests of banks conducted by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) and the BCE (in Europe).

A bank stress test is an analysis conducted under hypothetical unfavorable economic scenarios, such as a deep recession or financial crisis, designed to determine whether a bank has enough capital to withstand the impact of adverse economic developments. 

I was wondering why not to apply this process to the personal finance and I made Fintest (just a MVP). 

Fintest takes a holistic view of your finances to make sure you’re not only [financially stable](https://www.frugalrules.com/financially-stable/) but able to handle almost anything thrown your way. With this in mind, I’ve created a model which starting from macroeconomic scenarios and risk events (parameterizable), stress your money and push you into crash mode, and then, it will help you cope or recover from that.

I’m trying to fill this spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trnSlygwvvPW739b\_CJZS65mxoQMvseeuLr1m4WmnL4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trnSlygwvvPW739b_CJZS65mxoQMvseeuLr1m4WmnL4/edit?usp=sharing))  to know what other common situations could cause money stress in a ordinary person and what factors I should consider in my model to give a final score. Please, help me build the definitive list of risk factors or other ideas related to this.

I’m not concerned about how to monetize this yet, first I want to check if it can be interesting  but I have some ideas:

Option 1:

* Individuals plan: Saas Model. Free, standard and premium.
* Company plan: Saas Model. Free, standard and premium. (Not available initially).

Outsource your prospecting for businesses?,2,atytbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/atytbu/outsource_your_prospecting_for_businesses/,4,1550977544.0,"I've had an idea for quite a while. Me myself working in sales, I know that prospecting sucks and would rather spend more time closing new business. What about a web app where businesses get to select:

* the amount of leads
* calls/email goals (i.e. until an appointment is set)
* and set up a budget

Think about Google Adwords or Facebook Marketing if you may - but for cold calling, prospecting, and cold email. Everything that means cold (or the previous steps before making a sale) we take care of it.

Digital Marketing is the next big thing. But integrated with a follow-up, and exceptional customer service. It's a boom.

From following this, and similar, subreddits, it looks like most people turn down ideas because similar ones already exist and seem to dilute and underrate the niche effect.

I am a big proponent that if an idea is too novel, then it's not a good idea. Chances are that there was already someone else who thought abt it before you and did not pass market validation.

On the other hand, if an idea is already implemented and popular in some region, an entrepreneur can spin off a different version of it, or perhaps improve on it.

I was wondering whether anyone here has hands-on experience with SaaS or mobile apps that are a niche of a more popular well-known product, and became equally successful?",0

&#x200B;

After speaking to some people who embody the target market for this idea, I know that there are issues over mainly two things: 

1. Before speaking to others, users would want to ensure they look put together (ie: the perceived aesthetic demands of video may lead towards burdens relating to an abundance of time/concern in preparing to FaceTime)

2. Users could not easily be sure that they are speaking to those actually profiled on the app(ie: robots, fake profiles), and regardless, there is always the chance that there will be more obscene behavior leading towards discomfort we would not want any of our users to have.

Communion for Trail Runners,2,aucyej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/aucyej/communion_for_trail_runners/,1,1551073279.0,"(Background: I'm a former minister and currently writing my PhD dissertation on liturgiology/ecclesiology, so if you want to challenge the validity of the idea I'm game to chat, but know that this is at least potentially in line with modern theological conceptions)

&#x200B;

I love trail running, though now that I've moved to a new city it is a pretty lonely venture. I also, like many people, find being in nature to be a very spiritual experience. I go to church regularly, but it isn't a place where we take communion regularly. My idea is a Gu pack that contains electrolyte-fortified wine (possibly with a traditional (very low proof) alcoholic version and a non-alcoholic for non-drinkers) and a small basic wafer (possibly a traditional option and a gluten-free option). This could or could not be a replacement for an energy goo, but at the minimum would need to not upset stomachs on a long run.

&#x200B;

It would be the same size as a typical Gu (thus fitting into pre-existing gear). The bread would be in a three-sided piece attached to the back, so it can peel off without producing a second piece of trash. Behind the bread/cracker/wafer/whatever, there would be a  variable meditation and Bible verse appropriate to both finding God in nature and taking communion (avoiding the need for a phone). Since the wafer would be glued on separately, the outside of that bit of packaging could be numbered so the buyer can ensure they get different messages. There'd also be a reminder that you are joining in with every person who used one of those packs that week, making it a bit less lonely. It'd be written from a very general, pan-Christian viewpoint, avoiding major political stances so as to appeal to a wider group (albeit one that is liberal enough to consider taking communion on the side of a trail and a weird blend of hippie and religious enough to want to mark a moment as 'sacred' with this.)

&#x200B;

Communion is a personal time to take account of how one is linked to their understanding of God, but is also importantly a communal time that must be spent with the community. But, some people simply aren't able to gather for communion in person (for any number of reasons - sick at home, long-term nursing care, travelling, work schedules, running up a mountain, etc.).  I would envision people using this once a week or so, whenever they are running (not as a Sunday morning replacement). There could be a scaling-up with an app and social community.

"Restaurant for ""daily eating""",14,atwfny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/atwfny/restaurant_for_daily_eating/,18,1550963752.0,"I lived for several months in Brussels, working in the European Quarter. I didn't have a lot of income and the company didn't pay for our meals so I had to eat at the expensive restaurants in the area or bring food from home. In those days I thought that maybe a restaurant where I could ""eat every day"" could be a good idea. A place where you can eat simple, cheap and balanced meals on a daily basis, for the same price as it would cost you to cook it yourself and without damaging your health.

&#x200B;

I spent around 30€ a week on food so the cost of eating daily (breakfast, lunch and dinner) in this restaurant should not be more than 30€ a week.

&#x200B;

For a subscription of **86€ per month** you could have breakfast, lunch and dinner, from Monday to Friday (in Brussels).

&#x200B;

Example of a **""one day menu""** for subscribers:

* Breakfast: Milk with cereals (0.50€)
* Lunch: Macaroni with meat and vegetables,Fruit,Water(0,5L) (1.95€)
* Dinner: Hake,Salad,Fruit,Water(0,5L) (1.85€)

&#x200B;

**As a subscriber** you could design your own diets, or choose a predefined special type of diet (weight loss, bodybuilding, students, etc.).

&#x200B;

**If you are not a subscriber** you could get special prices if you accumulate a 10 day streak eating in these restaurants.

&#x200B;

**How to reach these prices?**

* Higher prices for unsubscribed customers
* Higher prices for customers with ad-hoc nutritional plans
* Customer loyalty
* Maximum automation
* Small variety allow you to buy more quantity of fewer products and take advantage of scale economy
* Sale of biofuel generated from waste

&#x200B;

**Cool stuff**

As a nerd/geek I would like to add some cool stuff to the restaurant like the option to taste lab-grown burgers, Soylent, robots in kitchen, in-table board games for customers that are waiting, live streaming of rocket launches, weekly thematic talks or language practice events. But all these things are optional and maybe make the prices way higher.

How could I validate this idea?

'Crowdcloud' - get paid for providing data,2,atvv0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/atvv0d/crowdcloud_get_paid_for_providing_data/,1,1550959826.0,"My idea is a marketplace for crowdsourced data for companies to request from and create new products and/or improve services with machine learning. Think a more broader version of Kaggle.

&#x200B;

For example, a company needs to create a program that can identify what a certain bird species is. It has a budget of $1m and pays 10000 bird species experts $75 each to identify and label certain pictures, which they do for a living anyway. Then the data is collated and put into machine learning algorithms, which are also crowdsourced from data scientists around the world who are also paid the remaining $250000 from the pot (almost identical to Kaggle). The result is a process which is more accurate than any individual specialist and can be used as a tool by said specialist. This algorithm is licensed or sold back to companies hiring those specialists.

&#x200B;

There are so many industries that can rely on crowdsourced data such as those that are geographically sensitive, healthcare, vision based etc. This portal would be similar to Kaggle except the data is also entirely crowdsourced by experts in the field as well. This is important as the data should have less outliers if those participating are experts in their field AND are being compensated for it. Those providing the data would be paid from the pot. To qualify, those people have to pass certain amount of questions from the companies hiring them.

&#x200B;

The main crux would be how to gather experts all in one place for any given project. Also, deciding which industry to focus on first and monopolise. Are there any glaring holes in this idea that you can think of?",0
Content publishing system for educational resources (steam for textbooks),5,ateb8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ateb8z/content_publishing_system_for_educational/,8,1550846991.0,"Preface:
I don't really have time for this but it was an idea I had about 10 years ago and didn't have the skills to achieve until 5 years ago. At which point I thought it would be totally pointless in another 5 but it still seems it may be relevant; though I could be wrong.
Also forgive me I'm on mobile and this is my first post so get your tomatoes ready.

Problem:
Students are constantly complaining about textbook pricing for their classes. And lots of professors even suggest not to buy the textbook and won't teach out of them (which begs the question: why does the class have it listed?). Professors also often don't have very good resources to collect and publish their own course materials. Often you are lucky to get some slides that are missing 90% of the content of the lecture.

Solution:
If there was an easy way for professors , and writers to collect and publish course materials, and a way for students to easily subscribe and pay for those course materials digitally without print you could save everyone some money, and time.

Some details:
For creating I'm thinking something along the lines of markdown that is pluggable with things like mermaid.js with a wysiwyg editor to make it easy to embed videos, images, and other resources with the text. Having a standard baseline will make it easy to add themes and help things feel cohesive even though there may be many publishers collaborating on a single set of coursework. 

There would two main kinds of publications:
- articles, which would be snippets of information explaining one topic or another, which could include diagrams, images, text, and videos.
- Collections which would be a kind of analog to text books. They would be made up of many articles and would contain everything you would need for a given class.


Monetization:

It could be a subscription, or pay per book I'm not sure. But as a professor you could sell your articles or even collections, but it could be done so that only other professors students would pay for publications that a professor wrote and a professor would not be able to collect money from their own students.  This could encourage collaboration between professors.  It would allow professors to get paid for their coursework directly and it would make text books cost less.

&#x200B;

The incentive I'd provide for people to already have these cars is:

1. free maintenance / checkups while I dismantle their cars to 3D scan all the parts
2. Reduced prices when they want to download the 3D model of a piece to 3D print it. 

&#x200B;

This repository will be helpful for manufacturers as well as they can reduce inventory costs and make classic car ownership more affordable when 3D printing becomes cheaper for the masses. This would be a long-time project requiring 15 to 20 years down the road, but I think some sort of open repository of all sorts of car parts would be really cool for both owners and enthusiasts. Maybe in the future you can download the parts to make your dream cars in VR or something too.

Shuit - The women's suit retailer,4,as72pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/as72pe/shuit_the_womens_suit_retailer/,4,1550584303.0,"In 2012, 5.8 percent of this cohort answered “yes” when asked, ""Do you, personally, identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender?” In the 2017 estimate, that numbered jumped 40 percent to 8.2 percent of millennials. According to the New York Times, around 64% of women have worn men's clothes before. I’ve come to terms and owned who I am but fashion hasn’t seemed to keep pase. Women wearing men's clothes is fast becoming more widespread than ever before.   “We’re in an era when men and women wear everything. It doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight. For us, it’s really about showing young women that they can wear whatever they want, said Danielle Cooper.” “When I wear a suit, I feel like I can do things I would not otherwise do,” Sara Geffrard said. “I’m a very, very shy person, but if I’m in a suit, I feel very confident. I feel like I can talk to whoever. Otherwise I would walk in and feel sort of small.” The dilemma is women's suits fit too tight and mens suits fit too loose. Focusing on the feelings of a power suit and their confidence is the untapped market . Women are limitless but mainstream clothes create boundaries. **Which has lead me to my idea:** Creating a mass suit retailer that is fit for masculine identifying or presenting, queer, gender neutral, gender fluid, and lesbian women ( LGBTQA+).

Hey, I’m a photographer/vlogger, I enjoy it whenever I can. However, I don’t carry my gears always with me wherever I go. So sometimes I have to use my iPhone,  it has an incredible camera with 4K/60fps. 

However, the problem is that whenever I use the rear camera to vlog myself, I can’t see what I’m taking video for. Hence, I might be out of borders or run into some video issues since I can’t really see myself while using the rear camera. 

I made a concept of iPhone case (similar to the smart charging case) but instead, I want to have a 3-4 inch display running on 800-900mAh battery with HDMI-lightening cable in between. The idea is that you can use the case as another display to see yourself while recording videos or taking selfies using rear camera.

I know that board game cafes already exists today (ex: The Uncommons in NYC, Coral Sword in Houston). At The Uncommons, there's a table charge while at Coral Sword, there is no table charge but you are able to purchase snacks and drinks at their cafe. For my business plan,  I want to charge customers hourly for their use of the table space, but the charge will also convert into credits that they can use to redeem snacks and drinks. The longer they stay to play, the more credits they'll earn. It gives the perception of ""free currency"" and ensures that the cafe aspect is still fully utilized. The latter is a important focus of mine as well as I often see cafes shutting down because people would sit with their laptop for hours and only ordering 1 drink during their entire stay, resulting in significant loss in ROI.

Looking for feedback on SaaS idea.,2,arll6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/arll6s/looking_for_feedback_on_saas_idea/,11,1550446648.0,"Hi, I am looking for input on this idea. Please try to KILL this idea, as well as support it, preferably in a constructive way.

&#x200B;

I'd like to develop a SaaS service to allow companies to onboard their customers on their websites. It works like this: when a new customers signs up, then our service helps the customer navigate through the company's website/dashboard in a scripted way we called ""**walkthrough**"" in a live environment. Each walkthrough consists of a series of steps, each one of which displays a popover targeting some element on the page. A popover can display text, links, video, etc., to help the user understand better. In addition to on-page, this works cross-page as well as cross-site.

&#x200B;

There are more use cases than customer onboarding. Use it for employee training, sales demo, customer support, etc. I'd even picture this to be an alternative to text-based knowledgebase: one can create a library of walkthroughs to cover common use scenarios, whenever a user has any question, he would search the library for the walkthrough to guide him out. Compared to a text-based knowledgebase, such an visual/interactive solution has its own value.

&#x200B;

A company using such a service reaps several benefits: better UX experience than documents and reduced customer support/training costs.

&#x200B;

*The above is obviously NOT a new idea.* Products based off of it exist for a long time. However, **I'd like to add a few things to try to make it stand out:**

&#x200B;

**1** it requires **ZERO coding** to create a walkthrough. Anyone who can browse the web can do it. Many existing products on the market require the maintainer to have some coding skills.

&#x200B;

**2** **minimum manual update**. When the company website updates, it only requires the maintainer to fix what's absolutely necessary, instead of update all existing walkthroughs. For instance, if the company has 70 walkthroughs, and the company website updates weekly, our product will ask the maintainer to update only 5 walkthroughs, instead of 70.

&#x200B;

Here is how it works: our system would crawl the company website periodically. When it finds any website change, it checks all the existing walkthroughs. For each walkthrough, if our service finds it's ""compatible"" with the latest website change, which means the walkthrough as is works on the updated website without any glitches, or our service is able to resolve on its own all the incompatibility issues arising from the website change for the walkthrough, it's done with it. Otherwise, it marks the walkthrough as ""dirty"", thus in need for an manual update.

&#x200B;

**3** **control flow**. Our product allows one to specify certain conditions based on which steps might be skipped, branched, terminated, etc. This opens up possibilities for implementing personalized walkthroughs.

&#x200B;

Pricing wise, I am thinking of a basic plan under 100 USD/month, then go from there.

&#x200B;

That's basically it. Again, try to prove the above ideas wrong, criticize with constructive comments. Upvote if you would buy such a service for your company. If you found any of the ideas has been implemented, feel free to mention the brand name.

Is there a market for an app where you could advertise what you are making for dinner and post a price and anyone that wants to eat it with you can reserve and pay to eat it with you or just eat it at your place or pick it up? 
With all the amazing ethnic cooks all around, wouldn’t it be cool to look up what’s cooking and eat there? 
Not sure of the dept of health logistical nightmare or allergy issues, but it could be stated in there. Like air bnb but for meals. 

The app would have a listing like the title of what you are making, then describing what is with the meal. Would list any allergy type foods but you can also choose that this is not for food allergy sensitive persons. Others can advertise specifically to vegans, gluten free folks, etc. Then you state how many seats or meals are available. The price of the meal. And if seconds are included or take out. Also where pick up is (city) and time.  then after the purchase/reservation then the actual address is given. Reviews can be given. Pics of the establishment given. Story about the chef or cook. Might be grandma cooking food from her hometown in foreign country you never heard of. How cool would that be. Probably the grandkid that always told her “you could open a restaurant” and here’s a way to live out that dream with no investment at all. I love this idea. 

I have thought of times when I cooked something and would think, “Man, I could sell this meal for $20” It would just give me more grocery money to cook more, plus maybe develop a local community where people eat in each other’s homes.

Would greatly appreciate any feedback or skeptical questions.

Nowadays, many people keep discussing how a certain innovation or breakthrough can be the next big thing. For instance, artificial intelligence, blockchain, etc. However, there is one obvious thing that many keep neglecting and that thing is something we have utilized for thousands of years. The power of teamwork. We have already solved some of the world’s greatest problems, reached to places far beyond our reaches, and constructed monumental structures. All this cannot be done by a single individual but only possible through the collective efforts of many.

Imagine the power to amass thousands of these individuals at once to help solve an issue or create something that the world can truly benefit from. This is where an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) can come in. An ARG blends the narrative of a online based game with the real world. Players must solve puzzles situated in the real world to advance further in the game's narrative. With this, players in the past have solved some of the most difficult puzzles and problems. A few examples to illustrate this potential.

* 4Chan users identifying the location of Shia Labeouf’s flag from just an image.
* Cicada 3301 decoding cryptography
* Year Zero ARG - locating real world GPS Coordinates to find the next puzzle pieces

To be honest, many of these things not even the most advanced AI or the largest company can perform.

Now this isn’t a company or an organization. This is not NASA. We don’t have a hiring process or specific technical requirements. This also isn't something simple like an online fundraiser. We are collecting the best talents just from ordinary people to solve problems with real world implications.

The question now is how can we effectively harness this power? The end goal is to create a startup or business that utilizes the efforts of people online to help the world.

Coming up with a suitable concept for this is also incredibly difficult. But there are simpler examples that can illustrate where I am going with this.

* An ARG event that instructs players to pick up trash. The end benefit is that a large area is being cleaned with just a virtual incentive.
* Asking a community to come together and decipher coded messages or archaic languages like hieroglyphics.

[Feedback] A database of 50k+ Angels and VCs to raise your capital 💸,8,ar2ulc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ar2ulc/feedback_a_database_of_50k_angels_and_vcs_to/,4,1550303088.0,"**Angel Match** is a database of 50k+ Angels and VCs to help you raise capital for your startup. ([https://www.angelmatch.io](https://www.angelmatch.io/))

Searching for investors who are the right fit for your business is an exhausting and challenging process. Manually gathering data by going through every investor's profile on LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Twitter, Personal Websites, AngelList, and email-finding tools is the last thing every founder has time for. 

We’ve compiled 50k+ angels and venture capitalists in one place, categorizing them by their names, locations, investments interests, past investments, and companies they are associated with. Angel Match provides investor contact tags such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and AngelList along with the links of companies they are associated with. Currently out of 50k+ investors, 43k+ of them have emails. 

💵 **Personal experience of raising capital:** About a year ago, I went through the process of raising capital myself for our Fintech startup called Richie ([https://richieinvest.com](https://richieinvest.com/)) and unfortunately we had no one in our personal network who could refer us to investors. So we tried cold-emailing and as a result we managed to set up phone calls with some of the most elite venture partners from FF Ventures, Light Speed Venture Partners, Cherubic Ventures, and the co-founder of a multibillion dollar startup [Wish.com](http://wish.com/). 

😰**Problems we faced searching for the right investors:** Since we weren’t able to find any decent tools that could help us find investors, we’ve searched and built our investor list ourselves using an excel spreadsheet. Jokes aside, it was not fun at all. In 3 weeks of hard work, we gathered the data of \~600 investors with their names, location and emails. That’s when we understood that there must be so many founders who face the same challenge as we did looking for investors. 

⚡️**Investor database' product we’ve built previously:** In June 2018, along with other 3 people, I co-founded **Investor Hunt**: a database of 40k investors to raise your seed round (turned into 3-4k MRR business). I worked on the marketing side of the product and I spoke with over 1000 founders and C-level executives of startups in various sectors. By listening to their concerns, feedback, and problems, I found that there were some **major flaws** that Investor Hunt had.

I’ve decided to build Angel Match from the ground up with my tech partner, creating a more sophisticated data searching tool and a reworked and improved algorithm. As a result, we have much richer datasets, more investors, more sources to verify the accuracy of information of investors, and better data updating tools. We’ve worked on Angel Match since October 2018 and today we are excited to launch the largest and the most comprehensive investor database that exists on internet. 

☝️Note: Angel Match has no association with Investor Hunt, it was independently built and developed from scratch. If you have any questions or feedback, I would love to hear them. Thanks for reading 🙏

Check out our MVP of an app that summarizes biggest tech news from the lat 48 hours,0,ar0683,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ar0683/check_out_our_mvp_of_an_app_that_summarizes/,4,1550287349.0,"**Link to our website:** [https://www.getnewscoop.com/](https://www.getnewscoop.com/)  
**Link to app:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lihter.newscoop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lihter.newscoop)

&#x200B;

My cofounder and I have always noticed ourselves not reading enough news despite being interested in what the tech world has been up to. For us, the reason was simply because we didn't want to read a massive article - we also just didn't have the time to do it. **To solve our own problems, we created** [**Newscoop.**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lihter.newscoop)

&#x200B;

In short, this is what we do:

1. We present a summarized version of all tech news - that means you only get the information you really need
2. All news on the app is available for 48 hours, after which it disappears - you'll never be reading outdated articles, ever
3. We categorize our news much better than a typical newspaper or even site like tech crunch
4. The interface is like snapchat's, it's easy to use and it's all about taps and swipes
5. We have 3 cool features in pipeline that are too much for a MVP, but will make the product whole

&#x200B;

**So, we'd love for you to try our app and tell us what you think!** If it's something you'll keep, tell us what you find good about it! If it's something that doesn't provide much value, tell us why and hopefully we can make it better using your feedback.

&#x200B;

All feedback is welcome through comments here or through reviews on the app.

We are doing an AI-solutions for enterprise customers, sometimes in education and employee assessment. One of our customers asked to make a trainer for public speeches. We did it. It’s a web application. You can go to our site and try to tell your speech to a virtual audience, so it’s like a public performance simulation. When you finish, you'll get an analytics report based on your pitch.

In this report you can see: - how you spoke, loudly or quietly in particular moments - which emotions you expressed at each stage of the pitch - whether you looked at the audience, or your eyes were wandering around - whether you used fillers a lot or not - whether you made long pauses or not - how often you used gesticulation, would it be worth using it less or vice versa - how did you manage to answer the questions (analysis of the meaning of your answers)

Also, our virtual listener can suddenly interrupt you and analyze your reaction to similar situations (emotions, the speed of response, voice timbre).

We are using a lot of machine learning algorithms, NLP, emotional recognition, speech recognition and other. We have already done this project, but we’re still hesitating if this trainer can be useful for delivering a better pitch. We are considering an idea to create this trainer like a separate product. What do you think about it? Do you train your pitch? How often? Is this product seem useful for you? I'll appreciate any feedback.",0

Fully Customizable 3D Open World Social network,0,ap6jwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/ap6jwb/fully_customizable_3d_open_world_social_network/,9,1549851298.0,"**Why Social networks come, fail and go:**

Every now and then, big social media websites and apps thrive and die easily. You work so hard to be one of the bests in Facebook, but after a few years it starts to lose the battle of publicity to other ones and all your past efforts reside unseen in the pages of history. This is the very sad truth of social networks and its only getting worse. One day vine. One day Insta, next day snapchat,.....

&#x200B;

The reason behind their success and collapse is the features, interface, limitations and their priorities toward types of media they let their users share.

But you can't make everyone happy and finally, they will move to a fancier social network with better looks and more features ( or just simpler and more robust ones)

The only way you can make people happy is letting them choose their own worlds, features, media,.... 

&#x200B;

**Solution:**

My idea is a social network in a 3D Modular open world Game Social media. 

I got to say for today's culture and technology this is far fetched to become reality, but give it 10 years from now and this could be the biggest Virtual World we live in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Modular User Profile Space:**

Every person's profile is basically nothing more than a blank 3D space with infinite dimensions (or limited dimensions with paid options to make it bigger)

One can put any media module he wants in this space, monitors to play videos and pictures, speakers to play music and audio, tablets for putting text content ( or they can add floating text everywhere they like), and modules are community driven and new modules will be developed every now and then and added for the systems

They can make their profile space like a House or they can make it as an asteroid floating in space. But the point is all their content could be shared in every way they like. 

&#x200B;

**Group & Social Activities:**

Instead of having Pages (Like Facebook Pages), people can make venue profiles. They Can make venues for Live music (Like the marshmello event in Fortnite), They can have seminars and speeches (Like VRChat, Second Life).  


Also, they can have group gatherings in each other's profiles and throw meetings and parties (just like online games and worlds (second life, imvu, VRChat,.... )

&#x200B;

They can add 3d models of themselves in the world (like VRChat) to appear in these gatherings and do live voice chat, and even add their live video feed to their models (Like Daft Punk LED Helmets to show their webcam feed)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE FEED:**

&#x200B;

obviously, this kind of super customized profile experience makes it hard for browsing through friends and followings feed. 

&#x200B;

The solution is another completely separate blank or customized 3D space, where you scroll through all other posts (just like a normal Instagram scroll but in 3d), but you can drag out any content and put it in 3D Space where you want to and by doing this, even your feed becomes a unique world of its own

 And obviously, you can save them to your own profile (Repost, share,....) 

&#x200B;

Just imagine this in VR And its already future proof. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------

**Future Proof:**

This Social network is basically a Virtual game world and we all know games last longer than Social networks. This Social network is VR Future Proof, The graphics will be updated every couple of years to maximize the experience, Many modules will be developed by the community and there will be more was to showcase and share content.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Difficulties:**

I know this is very very hard to achieve technically and it's just technically a big social AAA+ Game with much more customization level that any game offers now. 

&#x200B;

I also know that this social network is best experienced on Big computer screens or even VR, and it can't compete with mobile social networks right now.

But just imagine if the VR Becomes accessible to everyone, this will be the ultimate social network ever.

Think of it as this. An eventbrite event that allows people to join the event online. We will also broadcast the event live, so the viewer can view the event on his screen. This way, you can join and network with people even if you are not in the city. This also allows people overseas to network with people here in the United States and vice verca.

App to Skip Lines in Stores,1,aixczd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/aixczd/app_to_skip_lines_in_stores/,2,1548258085.0,"Since the dawn of shopping people have had to stand in long lines to purchase something in stores, especially on holidays. The idea I had in mind is to build an app that would allow someone to scan the barcode of a product, bill the store directly for it, get a digital receipt for the item, and then be able to leave the store then and there having purchased the product. 

So far I've just started conceptualizing this, and I think having people pay the store and getting a specific receipt would be the trickiest part as we'd need to work with each store to make some kind of a merchant account with us. But at the same time I don't think I've seen this anywhere. What do you guys think?

Layered Personal Garages,1,amiwu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/amiwu7/layered_personal_garages/,4,1549173512.0,"Ok bear with me. 

In a typical home, one garage-door equals one car spot or two cars side-by-side. However, what if there was a company/ new design that created created homes/ turned one-story garages into layered ones. 
Here’s how it works: 
You can drive one car into your garage and upon a pressure plate, the car is lowered into the basement and a super-strong glass panel covers the rectangular gap. Then, another car can come in through the same door and rest on that panel. 
Or instead of layered ones, you can have a cycling garage where the cars would rest on platforms that revolve around a central point. Kind of like bullets on a revolver. 

You can easily then turn traditional 2 car garages into 4 garages, or even 8 car garages with a revolving platform design.

One problem: expensive. And I’m not sure if the market is big enough for an actual profit.",0

I've been going back and forth on an idea of mine, which is: An online video course on how to set up and implement a lean, automated way to improve the reach and visibility of your content.

**It would really mean the world to me if you could give me your feedback 🙌🏻**

&#x200B;

It is focussed on SMB's, bootstrapping makers, (aspiring) entrepreneurs and bloggers who want to get more online presence without having to spend a day in the week on sharing stuff.

The title that I'm thinking about: Implementing Lean and Effective Content Marketing Using Automation

It will cover stuff like:

* The Content Marketing vocabulary explained
* The different types of content
* Generic tactic and approach for marketing your product/content/...
* Using tools (with free tiers) to improve and automate your marketing efforts

I am investigating Teachable as it is the first time I'd be recording a course (although I'm getting better at video editing and vlogging).

My questions to you:

1. What do you think of the idea for the course? Anything missing?
2. Is the title clear enough?
3. Would you pay for such a course? It would be about 6 to 10 episodes of video content, made up out of videos of me talking to you, discussing the topics and showing hands-on footage on setting up those tools for you.

Thinking between $60 - $150 dollar.

This is my idea...

**The Product:** This is an idea for a mobile application, it would allow a consumer to make a list for when they go grocery shopping, based on the list it would find you the best prices for the supermarkets closest to you around your area, which would in turn save you money. There is a lot more that could be scaled and extended on this one idea, and consumers who want to save time, money, use of coupons would turn to this as a one and done solution.

**The Market/Competition:** The size of the grocery retail market is huge and vast, this could even help big supermarkets as well as little mom and pop ones. There is always plenty of competition of course, and where they fail, I wish to improve on. E.g. Most of the apps on the market now only take into account items on sale, some apps don't include name brands in their comparisons, they don't take into account the local shops, the mom and pop stores, etc.  
**Stage:** I don't need money yet. What I need is a clear path for execution. Is this worth pursuing? Will I profit? Will I succeed? Is this scalable? I'm no investor, entrepreneur, but I'd like to move toward that mindset to be successful. I am an engineer FYI. I can be blind to a lot of things but I try to take it all in and learn.

Here is the concept. This app is aimed only for couples and people who are married. The app will offer a platform where you can share moments with your loved ones.

**Problem**

There are lots of relationships that won't work out at the end because of reasons both parties could have avoided at certain points of time while the bond was there. Every relationship evolves differently and as expected there will be good and bad moments. Sometimes we miss on opportunities to catch up on these moments to reflect or to pay attention to. Sometimes just words cannot express how much you really care about your partner.

&#x200B;

**Solution**

An app that allows couples to have their own private space on the net to share photos, diaries, jot down notes on things both partners like and dislike, view places to visit as a couple, talk to relationship coaches if needed etc. You see where I am going? For photos, sometimes you take lots of photos and even though you share it with your partner by sending via your phone it doesn't give you the personal touch to present those photos with a nice theme and add comments to each photos to make it even more special. If you have issues with your relationship you can connect with others to get advice anonymously if you like. There are lots of options and features i could think of but those are one of them

Coop loan app,1,anymuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/anymuy/coop_loan_app/,3,1549533927.0,"I am not sure how to see if someone had the same idea nor how to go about finding it out. I was thinking of a sort of ""Coop Banking/Loaning"" service, this is mainly for people with small to medium debts. 

The idea is to get a group of people together, have all of them pay a certain amount per month and have each member take the whole sum once a month until the cycle is done. For example, 11 people get together and each pay $250, then person 1 takes $2500 for month 1, then person 2 takes $2500 for month 2, until the last person. I was thinking of basically writing an app that would allow people willing to get into it, to meet with each other. Through the app, you can decide on the size of the group and the amount of money you pay. 

So why do it?
- The main goal is help people get out of the interest cycle, if you have a small debt (credit card or a quick loan), this allows to ease up your debt more easily.  
- Even if you have no debt, why not use the extra cash to help people. 

What's in it for me (the creator of the app)?
- I really just want to screw with the current system to be honest, I would like to get a percentage to maintain the app and of course money to live.

What could go wrong?
- How can you guarantee that someone will not take the sum in the first month and then stop paying? I am not sure yet, make it so it's legally binding and of course you get permanently black listed
- I understand that perhaps the interest system acts as a deterrent and can force people to pay their debt but I am willing to take a risk and believe that it can work.
- Might need a way to determine who gets the money when, most likely the fairest way is to have it random, unless members of the group all agree to let 'X person' take the sum.  ",0
Status Social network,5,anz0cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/anz0cu/status_social_network/,6,1549536408.0,"We're a small team of programmers who are working on building a new social network called Status. It's a single status social network (you can only have 1 status at a time) 

On Stat.us, if you post a new status, your previous status is deleted. We think this is a positive tweak to typical social networking.

Our model reduces waste, and prevents the accumulation of stale or irrelevant statuses from days gone by. These problems persist in existing platforms like Twitter, and have even lead to the creation of payed services, like TweetDelete, that remove your backlog of unwanted or embarrassing posts. 

The goal is to create a meaningful social network, where posts are relevant and new, and where past statuses don't accumulate. 

At it's core, Status approaches the problem of personal identity in a more realistic way. Your Facebook posts from 2007 are likely embarrassing, and not an accurate reflection of who you are today. We prefer a model that emphasizes who you *are* not who you *were*. 
It may seem like an insignificant point, but we genuinely believe that existing platforms fail to recognize the most basic characteristic of being human – constant change. 


While this model may seem played out, we believe that it has the ability to fundamentally change how we interact on social networks, by creating an inherently fresh, relevant environment.

Today, I was brainstorming ideas to possibly develop into a business plan soon. I currently work in the Apple store, and I noticed the price difference between the United States and Italy.

I'd like to possibly start up a website where we sell the iPhone to italian customers for cheaper than the Italian price of $1356. (Maybe, $1100 or $1200, not sure how much yet). And basically just undercut the price and make some profit per sell.

I am just looking for any feedback for this and more than anything, looking to see if an idea like this actually excites anyone. I work two jobs, but this idea wont leave me alone. I am thinking about going all in and building it. Looking for any help, I guess, hahaha

&#x200B;

**Alright, here we go:** 

I have always been a fan of all things fantasy/sci-fi & genre fiction as a whole. I am a gamer, avid book/manga reader and a binge watcher. In is within these worlds, characters and stories that I am truly alive and truly home…and it is only within the SFF community that I feel as if I have found my tribe. 

And yet, whenever I am interacting with the community (online or offline), I run into the same problem. There is an overwhelming amount of information, and I am drowning in it. And to make matters worse, the information is spread thin across endless apps, platforms and network. I get my reviews from YouTube, playthroughs on Twitch, news from IGN, group discussions on Reddit and Discord. Cosplay photos on Instagram. Purchases on Etsy. Let’s not even get started on the endless comic cons that seem to double faster than Moore’s Law should allow. 

What’s worse is that many of these outlets, which were founded upon and only upon the SFF community are branching out into other interests, industries and passions….all for the sake of the corporate dollar. Further diluting the blood of the community and adding to overwhelming chaos of digital information. 

**We are a tribe divided.**

\-The race of Men at the end of the 3rd Age in Middle Earth 

\-The squabbling 7 Kingdoms of Westeros before the Conquest

\-The Warring Factions before the invasion of the Reapers

We need a new home. An HQ. A Hub. A Base. A Citadel. **Our Vaes Dothrak!**

Yet, one that is more authentic to the voice of the SFF community

***Rogue*****:** *An independent news/media hub dedicated entirely to Genre Fiction & it’s fandoms.*  

“I do not wish to be the 5 star hotel out front, I want to be the speakeasy out back.”

A. Independent: Unlike corporate entities such as IGN whose content is brought forth by a well oiled machine, stripping the personality, authenticity or honesty from most of their Bloggers and Vloggers, all of our news/media content will be brought from independent content creators, only. Without the fear of competing corporate channels or content, our independent creators can truly flex their artistic ability without fear of demonetization or censorship. 

B. Genre Fiction: Only GF will fill our Hub, cutting down on the overall content output and streamlining “junk” that can easily fill any community. 

C. The Center of it All: Rogue will act as a central hub for the community, not to replace all the other outlets out there, but to be THE home and HQ where everything “Begins” or happens “First”.  **(e.g. \*Content Creators give us timed exclusivity to their content before releasing it to their other outlets\*)** 

Premieres, Breaking News, Reviews, RSVPs, Sales, Products, Live streams, etc**.** You may eventually read, watch or listen to GF content on any of the other outlets, but they will all have a common origin that you can trace it back to: **Rogue**

Of course, to experience something special with the rest of the community at it’s beginning is really what this is all about. 

Thus, by streamlining the content, eliminating corporate influence/competition and organizing content and community around a single Hub (if only for a moment) brings a type of stability, order and unification to the tribe. Where we can spend more timing communicating with each and relishing the moment instead of switching between 8 apps just to share and react with all the bonds we’ve made within this community. That’s the Haven I long to create. ",0

The design of the website would be beautiful, fast, and colorful (blue, purple, green color scheme). The key is that it would give you a complete picture of your finances on any device.

The front page will be a 2x3 dashboard that gives you grades (A+ to F-) on 6 different aspects of your financial health (emergency fund, credit card debt, savings rate, spending rate, investment mix). The dashboard lists quick tips, and factoids about your financial health when compared to the average person. The dashboard helps you achieve your goals by giving you a daily savings goals to strive for, like Microsoft/Fitbit activity rings.

Examples of dashboard tips:

- Your monthly food spending is up $200. 

- You have a bill for $13 due to PGE on the 3rd.

- Your Netflix subscription will renew on the 8th.)

Connects with your:
- Bank account

- Credit card accounts

- Federal loans

- Mortgage loans

- Autoloans

With those connections it feeds the dashboard, prepares professional financial statements. Helps you categorize transactions that can't be autocategorized. Also, helps you quickly file your taxes by giving you financial statements that you can forward to your CPA.

Benefits:

- Financial statements ready to go if you want to buy a house, refinance, or buy a car

- Financial statements can be sent to a CPA for taxes

- Immediately see unauthorized transactions

- Monitor your net worth in real time

- Monitor and manage your debt on 1 screen


Have access to financial data for far longer than a bank provides.

Food Truck Concept,3,amiiru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/amiiru/food_truck_concept/,0,1549171147.0,"This is another business idea that I want to exist near me but don't want to start myself. So hopefully this inspires someone and I get to enjoy it... Preferably in the Denver metro area... 

Name of the food truck: charCUTErie

Concept: charcuterie plates and gourmet sandwiches with fancy meats and cheeses

Menu: for the charcuterie and cheese plates, you could have two different ways to order, one would be ""chefs choice"" and the customer would ask for a rough price point, specify how many people it's serving, and describe their likes/dislikes. Or the customer could specify what he/she wants through a sushi style check list menu. The menu would list all the optional meats, cheeses, and accoutrements and their price per serving. 

For the sandwiches you'd have a seasonal/rotating menu of options like a prosciutto, brie, fig jam, arugula on french bread, or a fontina, shallot, and candied lemon panini on sour dough, etc.

You'd probably want your own meat slicer in the truck, but otherwise you only need to worry about storage of all your ingredients and a prep space. It would be much easier than having a full grill.

Once you've started the charCUTErie food truck, let me know so I can come indulge 😉. 

What else would you add to the menu? What are your favorite gourmet meats, cheeses, and accompaniments? ",0

Essentially, video games can be expensive, and despite many sales (steam sale, etc...) people still want to play newly released games when they are released.

What you could do is rent out a copy of the game online, sort of like an ebook from a library. The game would get deleted from the pc after the rent period is over. Players would also get a new, reset copy every time. 

Now, this idea has worked for many stores over many decades. The only difference is that my idea is for it to be purely digital, as in, a website with many video game titles to choose from.



Another alternative to this idea is a Netflix based system but with videogames instead of movies.

As the title suggest, there are so many events going on daily and you would see they don't get as much attention as they need and sometimes deserve. Walking around the roads, I find that it would be awesome if I could see what others thought while passing through that same road like random notes from fellow strangers. What if I was generous one day and had a gift card or something else and wanted to give it away to any random person? That's what I want to solve, I guess. (I know there are a few similar apps that does this but nothing that is streamlined and non-intrusive).

It would be similar to how pokemon go is but I am thinking of having a more texty-interface. Like navigation can be through texts that follow up on screen- ""oh you see that corner, move right from that. YOU WILL BE SURPRISED dang! it just move faster""  with a personalized character. Another thing could be to integrate it with facebook developers platform and have it available via messenger so one less thing to install.

So here's what will be the focus -

1. Implementing an event bounty system where planners can cash out some funds for people who attend it. It could be implemented in terms of virtual points and barcodes that anyone can print out and post on their walls. It would then later be directly paid into the bank or cashed out through gift cards.
2. Anonymous gifts at random spots that anyone can give out. Whoever will get there first will get it. Sort of like a treasure hunt.
3. Random notes that people can pass around when going through different places. Others can see those notes if they wish to.
4. If you are free, you can post a place to hangout on the map and get others to find you through.
5. Typing out your interests or keywords and when you are near someone who has the same keywords/interests, maybe you could meet them around? How about a coffee together? Get a notif and a mystery text to search for them.

So yeah, that's it. I was wondering if this idea was worth looking into.

As for the monetization, I think it would be okay to have a small cut through any payments passed on the system and having contracts with various travelling places/shops/malls/restaurants etc.",0

Uber but for taxi companies: C&C are more than welcome.,6,agsbny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/agsbny/uber_but_for_taxi_companies_cc_are_more_than/,10,1547716293.0,"Evening dear Redditors.

I kinda had this idea stuck in the back of my head, and I'm planning to implement it soon (I'm a developer, so an MVP might not cost me much). Polishing is a must, and validation is lacking, and haven't thought about it much. But I thought that this would be a good place to ask for opinions on the main idea.

I kinda searched for a similar service but to no avail, so I welcome similar references if there is any. My googling skills might be weak.

**Main Idea**

A taxi app that help clients request taxi drives, but taxi drivers belong to a certain company and are properly identified and ranked. The taxi drivers can be searched by performance, ratings and miles, and clients can pick between different options available (taxi drivers on turn).

**Needs (Pain Points?)**

1. Taxi companies are being currently displaced by Uber and other companies focusing on individual occasional taxi drivers.
2. Some people would prefer taxi companies, but many taxi companies lack an app or even a simple web page which could help them organize and  show their services, let alone help people trust their services.
3. Taxi companies often lack a system to organize, dispatch and monitor their drivers activity; they might not be willing to pay for a custom made service worth hundredths of dollars, and may just need to know where their drivers are, where they have been, the rides they have taken, and their availability (for all that, a smartphone seems enough); all of that from the comfort of a centralized office with a laptop.

**Business Model**

**Client Acquisition** Besides standard marketing efforts (web/facebook/twitter, paid adds for taxi company potential clients), I'm planning to go directly to taxi companies and offer them the service, to monitor and manage their float of drivers, on a free trial basis; if they like the service, they might pay a monthly amount. After that, implement ride-clients functionalities (rating, ordering, etc) and cover the client payments, offering the taxi line services an added benefit: a new source of clients and free marketing for their lines with their own page and contact info (along with reviews and stuff), and the possibility to receive payments directly via the platform (still under consideration). I'm planning on going local first, and then, going further.

**Revenue** I'm still deciding how to incorporate an in-platform wallet for the clients to use (regardless of the country), or just a fixed fee per car per month to taxi companies (and let them handle payment). However, both encompass different approach and the potential customers might not like this. Further research is required.

Take older cruise ships, ones that aren't cool enough anymore because they don't have zip lines and roller coasters built in, and retro fit them to be floating assisted living homes for anyone 60 and over.  Most cruises are already designed to be wheel chair accessable, so only minor modifications would need to be made to the state rooms. Then residents would rent rooms (annual leases) and that would be their permanent home. Mid January to Thanksgiving, the ship would sail the world and stop at ports of call. Instead of staying for just 8 hours though, the ship could stay for days at a time, then move along. By Thanksgiving the ship would return to the same port it started at and stay parked through the holidays getting repairs and allowing residents to visit family or vice versa. Through that whole time though, their room is always their own. Renew your lease Jan 1st and off you go again.

The staff and amenities would be nearly identical to regular cruise ships combined with assisted living staff. You'd have one or two on board resident doctors and you'd be required to acknowledge the inherent health risk of something like this by signing a waiver and agreeing to burial at Sea in the event of your death on board. Most cruise ships already have small morgues on board so no modifications need there. The biggest impact would simply be improving the onboard health facilities to treat life threatening emergencies and minor health problems. In the case of most non-urgent health issues, patients could get additional treatment in the country they are docked with or will be docking at next. Severing your lease and flying home would always be an option too.

Like regular cruise ships, where the crew is trained to be entertainers, servers, and so much more, this cruise ship would have a staff primarily trained in basic elderly care and hospitality. Keep all the same facilities, piano bars, cigar bars, pools, work out facilities, the spa & salon, etc. Focus a little less on the entertainment factor, but not by much.

I'd sign up for this in a heartbeat. Maybe do it for a few years until I got bored then go be a normal old person.",0
Fantasy Betting meets Gambling/Casino Games,3,aet9it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/aet9it/fantasy_betting_meets_gamblingcasino_games/,2,1547223036.0,"Hi!

After digging up a little on the legality of different kinds of games in India (my country), I found out that games which involve a substantial amount of skill in determining a player's outcome (win/loss) are allowed to be organised freely whereas those which rely on pure luck are not. While sports betting still falls in the regime of games of chance, fantasy betting (which I think of as a layer over normal sports betting) is perfectly legal as research shows that players' skills such as research on sports players' past performances, ability to determine the effect of weather on the play etc. play a part in differentiating the winners from the losers.

Thinking along the same lines, I was hoping to use the concept to modify old school casino games (like slots, craps, roulette etc which are purely luck based but also the highest revenue sources for a casino) which are otherwise illegal. Say you are playing in a batch of 50 players and before the start of the game the statistics of other 49 players are shared with you in the form of the amount of money they bet in previous games, distribution of their bet amount across various games, their win frequency etc. and then using these statistics you come up with a strategy for distributing your today's bet money which has been normalised to 100 points for convenience and then you allot these points on maybe the different players' performance or on the machines thereby betting on which machine will get the most traffic tonight in terms of total money bet on that machine.

I know that this all sounds too vague right now but I haven't been able to come up with a detailed version or the modification I was talking about.

1. Any reviews on the idea?
2. Any suggestions for resources I should look up to come up with the modification to old school casino games so that they can take a form where they involve skill? (I have been reading stuff on game theory games, resource allocation games, multiplayer coordination games etc)
3. Any modification idea itself you can think of to give me a lead?

Is there a tool that allows you to comment on web pages via a Chrome extension of something similar?,7,aeat2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/aeat2s/is_there_a_tool_that_allows_you_to_comment_on_web/,14,1547093622.0,"Here's the use case:

&#x200B;

I am a software engineer who, variously throughout my career, has mentored people looking to get into the industry. I've had a few successful mentees who have acquired the necessary skills and gone on to find employment. All that said, I would love to be a mentor as another stream of income.  


After some thought, I realize that mentoring directly requires a lot of time investment. In order to reduce that time investment, yet still provide value, I have considered designing courses which the mentees would complete on their own time. During this process, I would be providing assistance through various mediums, both synchronous (think phone calls, video chats, etc) and asynchronous (think email, texting, chat, etc).

&#x200B;

Now for the questions:

&#x200B;

1. First impressions, how does this idea sound? Is mentorship something people would pay for?
2. How might I go about validating such an idea?

Thanks in advance for the input.",0

the delivery will then be done by other passengers at the airport who have long layovers, so for delivering these orders at the gate, they get $$...

more catered to business travelers i suppose!

the delivery fee or menu pricing may have to be adjusted, to see what fits better...

lot of integrations with restaurant api providers, etc, but doable..

similar to uber eats/doordash, but inside airport, and the ones earning and ordering are flying passengers

Web app for Entrepreneurs,2,a8y8jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/a8y8jt/web_app_for_entrepreneurs/,1,1545627165.0,"Hello guys, I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and I have been thinking about a web app that will allow entrepreneurs to promote their products or services and sell them. I have planned most of it but I want to get some feedback of my idea so that I don't end up creating something that no one will ever use. The main problems I am solving through the app are:

* Product validation
* Product Development
* Selling

There will be two types of users; ones who post their product or services, and ones who give feedback for a reward (cash or gift card). Those who post a product (entrepreneurs), will share their product ideas and functionalities. They will be able to post the functionalities in a nested fashion for sub-functionalities and sub-sub-functionalities, and regular users will be able to upvote, downvote a particular functionality/sub-functionality. in this way entrepreneurs will be able to get user feedback of what funcs are most cherished by their users, even before developing the app. Users who are able to develop some functionalities will talk to the owner my direct message and fix a payment for developing it. Once the product is ready, all users who gave feedback on the product (by voting or commenting), will be notified and thus this will drive sales for products. Also if an entrepreneur has already has a product, he will be able to create a sales page using our app.

&#x200B;

I think the customer base for this app is: **Digital entrepreneurs**. I know I have to use some sorts of web framework to set up the backend of the app and also a database system to save user inputs. But instead of the development STACK, right now I am thinking about the app-idea in general. Do you think that this app will be able to help people to generate sales for their products? Do I need to add any other functionalities?

Feedback on Idea,5,adn08a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/adn08a/feedback_on_idea/,11,1546928206.0,"Hello World!

&#x200B;

Losing a loved one is a very hard time without the admin that goes along with it. This is especially true now that there are so many more services that we subscribe to ie, phone, entertainment, net, etc. Many companies have bereavement departments dedicated to making the process easier but it still requires the family to contact each individual service, then send off proof that the person has died before services can be cancelled or settled.

&#x200B;

This problem doesn't appear to have a satisfactory solution at present, or at least not one that is readily apparent here in the UK.

&#x200B;

The solution that could be delivered would be a service where the family submit the proof of death once, along with the services providers that need to be informed. Revenue would be generated by charging the user for the service.

&#x200B;

Benefits for the user; less stress, less time, less hardship.

Benefits for businesses; less time dedicated to 'dead' accounts, more pleasant user experience.

&#x200B;

Potential issues - charging for the service could create some resentment but there are many costs associated with the death of a loved one, so I do not believe that this would be too much of an issue. Proof of death would need to be obtained and any fraud identified, though there are existing protocols that businesses use that would be sufficient.

&#x200B;

I'd appreciate any feedback (execution, market, issues, etc).

&#x200B;

Thanks :)

Micro-gym concept,2,a5qg9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/a5qg9b/microgym_concept/,1,1544706681.0,"Just an idea I had recently - I don't like paying $40/month for a gym membership, when I really just use a few of the equipments there (mainly squat rack and bicycle).

If there was an option to pay $5/month for a gym that just had squat racks, I would definitely switch. The micro-gym can be much smaller (less costly to maintain, smaller space, so less money for rent, maybe even self-service), so it can still be profitable at a lower cost / month for members.

They are selling these silicone ""molds"" (a five foot silicone rope that is square shaped) for about $100.  

Not just on Amazon.  Everywhere.  They are $88 on eBay.  Minimum $70 at cooking stores online.  

It is for professional chefs to make sugar art like this 
https://youtu.be/Fg950eYLL0s

This silicone rope does not cost $99 to make.  Probably more like under $10 if that.  

Find a silicone molds manufacturer on alibaba, work out a deal to make the ropes, and severely undercut the ""Chicago Mold School"" who makes these $99 pieces of silicone and sells them in kits for $279.  

It is an invaluable tool to make kick ass isomalt and sugar sculptures that are gorgeous and worth a hell of a lot for parties and occasions, etc.

I'm just pissed off because I'm a home cook and I'm not paying $99 for a god damn rope made of silicone.  But dammit I need to make those sugar sculptures for my centerpieces.  And I have people who will buy them. 

No one else has anything comparable for sale.
