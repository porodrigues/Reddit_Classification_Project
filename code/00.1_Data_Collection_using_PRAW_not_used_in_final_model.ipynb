So imagine you set up your phone on a table facing you and record yourself following a dance routine. \\n\\nTechnical requirements: obviously I need access to the phone\\'s front camera, and I need to load and play videos, probably from a web server. \\n\\nGoal: create a fully functional MVP. There won\\'t be too many features, I want to start small and put something on the app store (or where ever). \\n\\nSkills and resources available: I have intermediate experience with Android native development and website development.

Seeing that finding employment at this time will be almost impossible and that we have sporting backgrounds (football administration and sports marketing), we decided to open a sports promotion and consultancy agency but getting clientele has been diffiult probably due to a lack of brand recognition and largely a monopolization of the market but we figure we might be onto something with our services (if of course given the chance to shine).\\n\\nTo try drum up some interest, we are thinking of releasing a ditigal magazine covering local/regional sports along with a special audiobook documenting the history ofdifferent sporting codes within our country.\\n\\nDo you guys think it is a viable strategy that can translate to interest sports fans? Even if we become successful on this front, there is the possibility that it could flame up or blow up and while wee aren't necessarily interested in being content creators, we are fearful of the setback it could cause. If by the chance we get successful, how do we then convert the interest of sports fans into something attractive for sporting organizations to consider working with us? While we have no clientele, should we focus on the content creation or should we entertain the idea of doing events free of charge to get the word out? Should we reach hope to professional sporting organizations to work for them on a free basis to get some rep?\\n\\nThanks for reading\",\n",

When I told him my reasons to dissolve the partnership, instead of being understanding, he went defensive mode and started attacking me saying he doubt my leadership abilities, that I'm not business centric and don't know resource management, lacks emotional stability etc.\\n\\nIt's ironic.

       "  'Since you guys enjoyed the last time we created a common list of VC/Investing terms here is another one:\\n\\nMore Common VC/Investing Terms\\n\\n1. **Soft capital commitment:** it’s when an investor says that he/she will invest money once some milestone is hit (generally that milestone is getting the lead investor). No papers are signed at this point and those commitments are very fragile. When the COVID hit most of such commitments disappeared in an instance.\\n2. **Lead investor:** The first investor in a funding round; can be also referred to as the anchor investor. Those are hard to find and sometimes anchor investors get better terms for additional risk they are taking.\\xa0\\n3. **Down Round:** A fundraising round in which a company raises money at a lower value than before. For example, if you raise your series A at 10 million valuation and then raise Series B at 8 million valuation - that’s a down round. Horrible thing to happen with a startup and sometimes kills the company completely.\\n4. **Anti-dilution Clause:** A contractual clause that protects investors from having their investment value reduced in future funding rounds. This clause protects investors from the down rounds - if she invested 2mil at 10mil valuation and a startup had to raise additional capital at 8mil, she will be given additional shares.\\n5. **Pro Rata Rights:** A contractual clause that protects investors from having their stake in the company diluted. This means that investors are allowed to buy additional shares at every round of funding to maintain their stake in the company. So an early investor in Uber might maintain her 1% in the company even on the day of the IPO because of that provision (she’ll spend some extra money retaining this stake of course).\\n6. **Bridge round/bridge loan:** A round of funding or a loan that helps a company achieve a certain milestone that it couldn’t achieve using money from the previous round. For example the founders have $100k in their account after their Seed round but they want to acquire additional 10k users prior to raising their Series A. That will cost additional $300k and at this point bridge rounds/loans are coming into play. Generally bridge rounds/loans are raised from existing investors.\\n7. **Cap Table:** paper that provides data on who owns what percentage of the company, when did they join and at which value did they invest. One of the must-haves at every single round of fundraising.\\n8. **Management Fee:** The fees that General partners of Venture funds charge their limited partners each year. VCs pay for their due diligence and sometimes provide support to the startup (such as accounting services, legal services etc.) by taking money from that management fee. If you work with a small fund, chances are they won’t be able to help you with that since their management fees are small.\\n9. **No shop clause:** A clause in a term sheet that prohibits founders from sharing the term sheet with other investors in an attempt to receive a competing offer. Rarely used in real life, but if an investor wants to sign one of those with you, run a very precise background check on the investor - that might be a sneaky move by a sketchy VC.\\n10. **Party Round:** A round in which a startup raises multiple investments from a lot of small investors. This is becoming a new trend because “it’s easier to raise 10k from 10 investors than 100k from one investor” - that statement isn’t always true so you have to assess the situation yourself. We recommend party rounds for founders with large networks of industry professionals who are making $100k+/year in salaries.\\n11. **Washout Round:** A round in which founders and previous investors get significantly diluted. The new investor in this round will most likely gain majority ownership. Basically it’s like a bad version of the acquisition. Washout Rounds (similar to washout sale) happen in the situation of the company crisis - this is the last resort for a startup.\\xa0\\n12. **Lock-up Period:** A specific amount of time that must pass before someone can sell their shares in a startup. That’s one of the downsides of IPOs - founders of the company frequently face 6-18 months lock-up periods and that’s why some companies (like Spotify) prefer direct listing. These provisions also prevent investors in your company from running around selling your shares the next day they bought them.\\n\\nSome of these terms we got from the previous post, so if there is something you’d suggest us to include in the next article - make sure to comment what it is that you want us to cover next!\\n\\nAnd here is the link to our previous post on this subreddit: [top 10 terms in fundraising](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/j3fcvx/10_major_terms_used_by_startup_investors_a_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)',\n",

I wasn’t even made aware this was an entirely different company—I was initially told that Company B was just the name of our new product. Company B is an entirely separate entity legally and has no employees. It’s been in place for well over 7 months now.\\n\\n- Company A had significant investment put in by a variety of investors. None of them know that Company A is essentially just being drained out so that my sketchy and neurotic boss can fund his new project ie Company B.\\n\\n- They had me write/contribute to two important documents for Company B: an investor memo, which is essentially a sales pitch to get investors to invest, and a government funding application. On the first, I was told the product was ready, so investors were led to believe it’s completely ready. On the second, my boss edited my work by saying that the product was in the R&D phase. I confronted him about this yesterday, asking which it was, and he said “neither”; that the product is well advanced, just not fully out to market. When I asked if I could send corrections for the two documents he said no—that both documents are “just marketing materials that you’re supposed to adapt to your audience”. While that’s true to an extent, product readiness is a substantial item that needs to be presented accurately.\\n\\n- In this same conversation, he went on to say that governments are dumb and you just say what they want to hear. This has me thinking that he’s probably been dishonest in other parts of the business, and probably done so with Company A too.\\n\\nWhat do I do here? This is not okay.

Introductions:  Please practice a 90 second elevator pitch about yourself.  Rehearse this until it becomes effortless.  It should hit all of the important pieces of your story that you want to get across but don't need a ton of detail.  Please please don't use up valuable time covering things that don't advance your story.\\n2. The inspiration:  I like to hear what inspired you to choose the path of entrepreneurship and this specific problem.  I also am hoping to hear why you are uniquely qualified to solve it.\\n3. Problem:  Your problem statement and why this is a big problem for many people.\\n4. Solution:  Your unique solution to this problem.  What makes this special in the market and differentiated from the competition.\\n5. Demo:  Please be prepared to show a demo.  If none available, have mockups or a prototype to walk the investor through.\\n6. Traction:  If you haven't launched yet, tell me why and what you are doing to solicit customers now.  If you have launched, have your KPIs ready to discuss in detail.\\n7. Financing:  We'll discuss how much you're raising, how much you have raised, how much you have left, who else is invested, the terms, etc.\\n8. Next steps:  Either I'll share my feedback right away if I feel strongly one way or the other, or I take it back to my partnership to discuss more.\\n\\nBy and large, raising money is a numbers game.  Most founders have to pitch at least 40-50 investors to get the ball rolling on their rounds.  This is normal!  Keep your head up.\",\n",
       "  'I had joined this growing startup as a CTO. I had been introduced to a 60 member engineering team where most of them are developers and doesn’t have any managers. The 60 member teams are split into pods who work on different product vertical. Earlier the 60 member team was managed by ceo itself ( who is a tech guy). But later hired me to handle the team. How do I go about this? I have been observing the team and found the following issues\\n\\n1. The pods are directly managed by product managers. Engineers are not growing nor have a proper reporting structure. Each Pods include front-end, back-end and qa.\\n\\n2. Engineering team has a lean structure which results in ownership issues despite having a team lead for reach POD.\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\n1. There are around 10 pods. Should I hire engineering managers for each of the pods or handling multiple squads and get in a director who would be managing the engineering managers?\\n\\n2. Does creating too many hierarchies creates communication gaps?\\n\\n3. Should I hire just engineering managers directly reporting to me without a director or vp? \\n\\nI have never managed team of this scale and this is new challenge. Looking out for expert advises :)\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nThank everyone for such a huge response :). I think I got a lot of insights here. Just giving few updates to the question on certain questions asked by few.\\n\\nOne senior ( Backend or Frontend) is the leader of a POD. For eg: If a POD is taking care of Dashboard, a frontend engineer would be the leader of that POD because PODs work is more frontend intensive. There would be backend engg to support but the leader is FE guy. If a POD takes care of transaction processing, BE will be leader. \\n\\nThere are concepts here similar to spotify chapter which they have implemented. All backend engineers report to a Sr backend engineer ( who was a very initial team member, but I feel he has a hands on developer for 4 years, limited experience ). All frontend reports to a Sr FE dev ( pretty good with exp ). \\n\\nThe application is moniloth ;). Thats another big challenge. The startup had grown so fast that they were on a run to build and ship. But micro-services is one roadmap to be considered. \\n\\n\\nHierarchy is as follows\\n\\nPOD1.....N -> POD Leaders -> CEO ( Now myself )\\n\\nWhat I am proposing ( Not sure its gonna work out though )\\n\\nPOD1....N -> 5 POD leaders reporting to an Engineering Manager ( Bad idea ;o ? ) well budget is a constraint as well. Total two engineering managers reporting to me. Later get in a Director to manage EMs and scale EMs as well? And get in a Technical Architect to look at roadmap for splitting monolith to micro to guide the team?',\n",

As long as the product does not have a history that ties everything together, these markers are empty.\\n\\nStep 2. Identify Brand Messaging. All these points help greatly to feel the brand, find its features, flaws, \"wrinkles\" and present it to people through design or content.\\n\\nStep 3. Identify Your Key Customer. For whom everything is planned? Make a detailed portrait of them, because the more specific you describe your person, the easier it will be to understand how to enter their world with your offer.\\n\\nStep 4. Identify Your Competitors. You need to understand how your competitors work and find your benefits in comparison to them and to highlight them.\\n\\nStep 5. Design Your Individual Elements. By this time, you have a ton of information to start the identity creation. At this stage, you want to take that text-based information and translate it into visual concepts.\\n\\nStep 6. Build Your Brand Style Guide. The only thing more heartbreaking than a poorly designed brand identity is a beautifully designed identity that is never used or used incorrectly.

OR, perhaps I have no choice but to use a framework such as ionic for this. Please see below for detail on my experience and the app functionality I'm looking for.\\n\\n**My Experience**:\\n\\nI work in data science and have good understanding of python and object-oriented programming.

The tools give us the bandwidth to scale and hop on to new opportunities.\\n\\n**Highlights:**\\n\\n* Why we failed for years\\n* Our Strategy for the launch\\n* Our next steps to growing the agency\\n\\n**Why we failed for years**\\n\\nBefore all of these happened, my partner and I were serving the military. For the past two years, we embarked on many dead-end projects. That had us wondering why we were not making as much as we want to.\\n\\nMy partner was an SEO expert. He ran an adult fetish site pulling 30,000k monthly view but could not monetize it. On the other hand, I was somewhat decent at generating business leads and doing sales calls. I ran a b2b lead generation company that could not scale.\\xa0\\n\\nIt was not a skill issue.\\n\\nThings were also pretty rough then, with the army taking up most of our time and mental space. We spent all of our time working on our “side-hustles”, skipping out on parties, gathering, and all the stuff.\\n\\nI had this constant fear of not succeeding because it only meant two options. I had to either find a job or go back to school once my service ends.\\n\\nNeither option was appealing to me.\\n\\nThings continued to be a complete train wreck. The Covid-19 locked down happened nearing to the end of my service. It gave me time to focus and move as we were under stay home orders.\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, we were not moving in the right direction. It felt as though we were still banging our heads against the wall, this time harder and faster.\\n\\nBefore I knew it, I was out of the army. The direction was still murky, but with every failure and reflection, things started to click. Things were difficult and glim because we did them backward. We were solving problems before they even happen, such as information retention, tracking … etc. You can read my other post [here.](http://mvrck.io/2020/08/22/how-i-improved-my-productivity-by-fixing-my-workflow-and-retention-issues/)\\n\\nI took the risk and canceled my university admission. I wanted to focus on making this business work.\\n\\nIt dawned on us that we were not out there at all. We were so focused on building the right service or product that we did not put it to test in front of the market. We had the skills, tools, and knowledge to scale but we could not because we have not gotten past step one.\\n\\n**What is step 1?**\\n\\nYou need two things to make sales.\\n\\n1. Having an offer that your market wants\\n2. And getting your market to see your offer\\n\\nAs stupid and generic as it sounds, there are no secrets. If you want to validate your idea, create a landing page with a sales copy and put it in front of your target audience.\\n\\n**Our Strategy for the launch**\\n\\n* Find an idea traffic source\\n* See what the are our competitors were offering, then make it better\\n* Compete based on price point to get the volume\\n\\nWe found a local listing site where people list their services or items. We researched all our competitors and decided that we could offer a simple web design service. There was not much competition as our competitors were not copywriters and their listing creatives were terrible(Funny how they are designers LOL).\\xa0\\n\\nNext, we created a customer avatar based on the listed services, Reddit threads, local Facebook pages, and so on. This process helps us craft a sales copy that speaks directly to the market.\\n\\nWe built a landing page, put in the copy, and threw in some illustrations from our tool stacks, and we have a minimum viable landing page ready to go.\\n\\nBranding and positioning matters, as your ideal customers buy based on the impression and general vibes you give them. So you have to stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\nLastly, we priced ourselves just below our competitors. Pretty sure this is counter-intuitive to what most Gurus preaching to charge your worth.\\n\\nWord of advice is to drop your ego, get the cash in hand, and prove your worth later. Leaving the table with money in your bank account is better than going home empty-handed. Moreover, you never know who this client can refer you too. Relationship building is of the utmost importance when it comes to the agency, so do not burn bridges.\\n\\nThe service was up and live shortly after that. Duplicated our listings a couple of times to maximize exposure and also understand how the platform algorithm works.\\xa0\\n\\nIt was around the mid of the second week where we noticed a spike in leads. I was getting incoming calls almost every day.\\n\\nThe leads were all over the place. Most were enquiring about services we do not offer but had the skills and knowledge to fulfill them.\\xa0\\n\\nOut of the 25 total discovery conversations we had, we filtered down to 5 serious candidates. We closed all 5 of them over a 30-45 minutes video conversation with prices ranging from $399 to $6,000.\\n\\nHaving a sales process is extremely important. Most consultants would spend hours talking to clients that would not pay for their service and products.\\xa0\\n\\nI would structure the sales process with a 10-minute discovery conversation at the start. The initial call helps me gauge the prospect’s level of commitment, budget range, and decision-making process. I would then schedule a strategy session. However, if they sound fishy or the deal did not felt right, I would disqualify them. (Always stick to your principles.)\\n\\nThe strategy session is a 20-40 mins video conference where we find out if the prospect is a good fit. During the session, we understanding their pains, agree on the price and handling objections.\\xa0\\n\\nOne tip here is to collect a deposit instead of asking for the full price. We would then schedule a kick-off (onboarding) call where we meet them and get into the details and collect the whole sum.\\n\\nWhy? Because this lowers the resistance and prevents a buyer’s remorse. If the prospect is willing to pay you a deposit, they are committed and would pay you the full amount after onboarding.\\xa0\\n\\nThe other reason is that you are leaving your cash flow to factors of the unknown.\\n\\nFor example, a client might commit to paying you after the onboarding session seven days away. Something might happen during the week and cancels the engagement. It always happens, so always secure a deposit and remember cash on hand is king.\\n\\nThe onboarding process makes or breaks your relationship with your prospect. I have seen too many gurus talk about closing sales in one phone call and all that BS. Having a great sales process and a shitty onboarding process is like getting catfished on a dating app. It would not do good for your reputation and affects your future businesses.\\n\\nA well thought out onboarding process instills confidence in your client. One scenario that happened during the kick-off session was that the client was not exactly sure about engaging us because we were young (22-year-olds)in Asian culture. But after the onboarding session, he was extremely impressed with it. He told us that we knew our craft and felt confident in our capabilities that reflected in his firm handshake as compared to before.\\n\\nDuring the onboarding process, set the right expectation by understanding your client’s goals, address their concerns, and formulate an action plan of deliverables to achieve the set goals. Do not make promises out of thin air and results, show transparency by helping your client visualize how the actionable deliverables would lead to the outcome they envision.\\n\\n**What is our next step?**\\n\\n… And we just rented an office last week.\\n\\nWe are on track to hit the goal to hit 10-15k MRR within the next four months. After that, it would be just scaling, funding other ventures, and ultimately build an agency that can run without us.\\n\\nHere are our key movers:\\n\\nOptimize our presence (offline and online) to exist in multiple places to receive opportunities.\\n\\nHiring and building an internal team.\\n\\nImprove our lead generation through strategic partnerships (networking)\\n\\nBuilding out internal structure to scale(Financials systems, Work tracking, Goal setting)\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post.

I was excited for the project, but when it came time to actually take my saw to the first railing to demolition the old one, I had to stop. I literally sat there for a good five minutes because I realized that if I cut through that piece of wood, I’d have to finish the project. I had to take that leap.

       "  \"Hello guys,  \\nMy startup is about game rentals. This is more or less the idea: I have a site/app where people sign-up and place their games, that they are willing to rent out, on it. The renter pays a bit of cash to be able to rent out the game for a month or so. I get a portion of the money (like 20%) and the rest goes to the loaner and all 3 parties are happy. \\n\\nNow, the question that I get a lot is: How can you make sure that the renter gives the game back? or Can't I just loan out a game that is defect and when the renter then claims that the game is not working, I could blame it on him so that he would have to pay me back the worth of my game? I got asked about these and several other scenarios of fraud. \\n\\nMy initial idea was to make people that sign-up to register with their visa card so that if someone didn't return a game I could claim the value of the stolen game or that as long as a game is rented out I would 'freeze' a certain amount of money on the visa card until the game is returned. But neither one of those options would protect the renter from fraud, from the loaner lying about the condition of the game and blaming it on the renter. Other solutions where for example that if you put a game for rent you have to first send me a video that shows how the game is working properly but this can easily be faked. Another idea would be to have the renter to see  for himself that the game works before he loans it out, that would mean that the loaner actually had to invite the renter into his house and I'm not sure if that's a good idea.\\n\\nI don't want to give up on this idea because I really like the idea of this community effort that basically makes everything tick and I live in a very small country as well which makes the delivery so easy. If you guys have any solution for my problem, that would be great. Every idea, constructive criticism or heads-up is more than appreciated.\",\n",

       "  \"Hi all!\\n\\nI recently launched a newsletter, summarising books and other content to provide lessons for entrepreneurs but didn't have a clue how best to secure sign-ups. I posted on forums, asking for hints and tips - which proved to be very helpful. Overall, things were very successful in terms of my initial launch (recieved over 100 subscribers) and thought it would be good to share some things that worked for me.\\n\\n# Takeaways\\n\\n**1. LinkedIn**\\n\\nBecause LinkedIn is meant to be a professional network, this was a great help for me - and probably the source of most of my initial sign-ups. One helpful tip is to link the launch of the newsletter/product to your current career journey. This way, people who know you, who may not even have apparent needs for signing up may be more willing to support and engage with the post. This is helpful because that places it in theirfor their contacts to see - spreading your initial circle quite quickly.\\n\\n**2. Target Audience - Platforms**\\n\\nOnce I had started securing the low hanging fruit, I started trying to reach my target audience - entrepreneurs. One example that I used was Indiehackers - a platform for founders to share thoughts, ideas and progress. A relevant post in these settings led to over 100 comments, 50 likes, and a good number of subscribers.\\n\\n**3. Other Socials**\\n\\nThese were useful, but the ROI felt lower pre-launch. However, post-launch, this created avenue for sharing content. Because it was a newsletter for example, I was able to repurpose the content, and post snippets on other platforms that referred to the source. This was helpful. Placed a reference to the blog on the bottom corner of all original graphics. Additionally, I shared the first post on LinkedIn after the launch too.\\n\\n**4. Distributors / Directories**\\n\\nFinally, I placed the newsletter on several up-and-coming newsletter directories. This hasn't yielded a large number of results just yet but a few sign ups are trickling in over time.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIt's not been easy, but it's definitely something that can be replicated by others. Leveraging as many funnels as possible for any launch is helpful. That said, would love to hear whatever tricks come to mind for you?\",\n",

       "  \"I just saw yet another post for help where the person didn't want to say what their idea is. You've probably all heard that ideas are worthless but I'm going to try and lay out why execution is everything.\\n\\nI've built a business that has over a million in sales annually but covid has flattened our growth from 300% yoy to 0%. So we need to switch things up. I've got a fantastically talented team, so I worked through every lost sales over 3 years and why, formed a hypothesis about the problem. Thought about it for a while had an idea that seemed to tick the boxes and the team liked it so we started that direction. Then one day the lightening rod hit. I had a great idea how for what we needed to build, it wasn't the mostly generic thing I first came up with, it was new and it was going to be great. \\n\\nI told the team they thought the idea sucked. I drew pictures and workflows and explained all the rational and I managed to move some people to on the fence. So I just said fuck it and built the prototype myself. The suddenly everybody was like oh this is actually great. \\n\\nI have a team of people who have been living this problem for 4 years, who are passionate about what they do and super talented, yet they couldn't see all the detail in my head about how to actually make the idea work, so they didn't get it. \\n\\nThis happens with things big and small. Another one from last week was after my direction, the designer made a design that was a little ambiguous the coder interpreted it wrong and for various reasons the team was convinced that the way it had been done was actually better because it allowed the user more freedom. So much so that it caused quite a dust up. Anyway to keep everyone happy we went with new user testing, they were amazed at how much new users struggled and quit the product with their way and all the alternative the users just glided through. \\n\\nIt is so hard to get people to fully believe and buy into your vision for a product, it takes constant work to keep course correcting and to figure out what battles are close enough it's not worth fighting. Vision isn't a once off, it's a constant. \\n\\nAlso the thing is that no matter how novel your idea is you'll probably find that there are competitors. With our first product we didn't do deep competition research, when people saw our product they had never seen anything like it and we thought it was totally new. Turned out that 2 competitors had had the idea 5 years before us. Also turned out that some people liked our execution more, so it wasn't a big deal. \\n\\nEven with this latest product when we went looking we found competition. Luckily not as well set up as us and their products kind of suck but they had the same core idea. \\n\\nI've been in the startup game for a while and it seems like even with wholly new things, if there is a set of circumstances in the world that give you the spark of something original and great, that has never existed in the course of humanity, then it probably happened to a few other people and some of those people probably have access to lots of cash. \\n\\nExecution is so key, Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social media platform. You don't need to be the first or the richest but you need to realise that you're in a race from the outset and execute to make something that some people love. \\n\\nIf I can take everything of value you have to offer a company from one post, then you had nothing of value.\\n\\nEdit: The point is not that ideas are totally worthless, a vision is more than an idea, it's a lot of ideas and decisions, communication, leadership BUT people scared to share a one reddit post's worth of information on their concept when asking for help. They have nothing of value to lose by sharing and in fact people can't help them effectively unless they tell them their idea.\\n\\nEdit 2: People complaining about me not sharing my idea. It's all over my post history:\\n\\nMy company makes enterprise grade, high performing machine learning easy.\\n\\nWe automate a lot of the work a data scientist would do manually and do it to a a very high level of quality automatically. It's a development tool, so it's cross industry. \\n\\nFeel free to take that idea and make a company. You have my blessing.\\n\\nEdit 3: I'm not saying the people with the ideas have no value, I'm saying that it actually takes a lot of hard work and time to fully communicate your vision, so the value of an idea by itself as would be communicated in a reddit post has no value, without the person who had the idea there to keep filling in the blanks.\",\n",

Recently bootstrapped a very small company that focuses on making law school education more efficient, it's essentially a new study tool that we plan to sell to law school students using a SaaS model. We're in some promising talks with a major education company who wants to partner with us - my team would develop all the content for the service with a few legal scholars who are on our team, and do front-end development of the tool, and the company has a team that could do all the back-end development, plus marketing/sales/etc.\\n\\nThe company wants to know how we want to arrange a partnership. We originally planned on just doing our end of the work for a hefty flat rate, handing it off to them, and being done with it. However, the market for this tool turns out to be a lot bigger than expected, so we've decided we would rather take a pay decrease of the up-front price but maintain some ownership of the product and remain entitled to an ongoing cut of the SaaS sales. The up-front cost on the education company's end would probably be relatively minor, and it's projected to easily pay for itself within the first 6 months, with very minor ongoing costs after that (just maintenance and minor updates). Pretty low-risk. They've made it clear that they definitely can't do this in-house if we didn't partner with them, which puts us in a pretty decent position (but we also can't do it without them, at least not on such a big scale).\\n\\nBut I have no idea how to structure this, or even where to begin a discussion/proposal.

Hopefully this could give some insights to people in the same stage.\\n\\n# Quick reminder on the set-up\\n\\nThere is an existing dominant app that can\\'t solve a common pain point as that would require either a lot of investment or a complete shift in the way their users interact with their platform. \\n\\nI have built a landing page to test my idea, basically, the landing page is your straight-forward pre-launch landing page with the what, why and how of the app PLUS:\\n\\n1. An email collection call to action where users can register for early access (Subscription)\\n2. A survey where users are asked a few questions and are invited to give their feedback\\n3. Share buttons to help those who wish spread the word about the app\\n\\nThe app would ultimately be a web-app and a mobile app.\\n\\n# First of all, the ads\\n\\nAs I explained in the previous post, I decided to run the ads initially on 2 platforms (Reddit and Facebook) for 4 weeks focusing exclusively on the people around me. I have made it so that the exact same ads run on both platforms. On week 3, I\\'ve added Google ads as well as they were giving some free credit for newcomers.\\n\\nEach ad was an image showing a phone with a screenshot that illustrates the main pain-point I am trying to solve. On Google ads, there was only one text ad running which was basically my app\\'s slogan.\\n\\nHere are the CTRs by platform by week:\\n\\n||Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**Reddit**|0.25%|0.24%|0.28%|0.25%|\\n|**Facebook**|0.48%|0.49%|0.49%|\\\\-|\\n|**Google**|\\\\-|\\\\-|0.58%|0.52%|\\n\\nYou will notice that Facebook was removed on Week 4, this is because in terms of actual conversion rate once the user landed on my page, Facebook was inferior to Reddit, so I\\'ve decided to stop it and reallocate all the budget to Reddit.\\n\\nThe total ad cost for the 4 weeks was 270$.\\n\\n# Conversion rates once visitors are on my page\\n\\nOnce visitors landed on my page, I kept on tracking what was happening through Google Analytics and was able to get data on which platform was performing better, this is why Facebook ads were stopped on Week 4 for example.\\n\\nBelow are the different conversion rates for Subscription and Survey per platform (Basically, out of 100 visitors coming from Reddit on Week 1, 4.65 of them subscribed to the mailing list). You\\'ll notice that there is a 4th platform \"Other\", this basically takes into consideration traffic coming from share links (i.e. users sharing the landing page on Facebook or other apps) and traffic coming directly to the site with no apparent referrals (which I believe is still coming from shares as there is no way someone would just stumble upon the landing page by themselves).\\n\\n||Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|Overall|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**Reddit Subscription**|4.65%|4.61%|4.78%|5.73%|5.10%|\\n|**Facebook Subscription**|4.02%|0.48%|0.63%|\\\\-|1.67%|\\n|**Google Subscription**|\\\\-|\\\\-|4.60%|0.30%|1.65%|\\n|**Other Subscription**|9.63%|15%|31.57%|7.40%|12.75%|\\n|||||||\\n|**Reddit Survey**|2.17%|1.53%|1.06%|1.58%|1.64%|\\n|**Facebook Survey**|1.72%|0.48%|0%|\\\\-|0.74%|\\n|**Google Survey**|\\\\-|\\\\-|0.65%|0%|0.20%|\\n|**Other Survey**|6.02%|0%|5.26%|7.40%|5.37%|\\n|||||||\\n|**Overall Subscription**|5.18%|3.29%|4.45%|3.70%|4.13%|\\n|**Overall Survey**|2.59%|1.02%|0.77%|1.15%|1.39%|\\n\\nAs you can see, Reddit was the most consistent platform in terms of people coming and actually signing-up, for some reason, both Facebook and Google yielded some interested people at first but very quickly generated traffic that didn\\'t lead to any interesting action. I have no clue why it would be that way though.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting to note here is that people coming through shared links via Facebook and Whatsapp were the most converted. With an overall Subscription conversion rate of 12.75% and an overall Survey conversion rate of 5.37%.\\n\\nFinally, Reddit brought in 64.36% of all subscribers, shared links brought 18.81% of all subscribers, followed by Facebook at 8.91% and Google at 7.92%.\\n\\n# The survey results\\n\\nThe survey was a small set of required questions that aimed at validating whether the market suffered the problem I set out to fix and to what extent. It also allowed users to answer optional open-ended questions on how to improve existing solutions and to describe how the current experience is. It was answered by quite a number of people at the end.\\n\\nThe open-ended questions line-up completely with the issues I have in mind.\\n\\nAs for the other questions, the main one was \"How many times have you encountered pain-point while using the competition?\", to that one, 6% have reported to have never experienced it, all of them have used the competition 1-3 times in the past year. 58% have reported to have experienced it every single time, 95% of these have used the competition over 5 times in the past year. The rested have reported experiencing the pain point some times.\\n\\nThe other questions were about two ancillary pain-points. 81% of people responded that they have experienced the first and 65% of people responded that they have experienced the second.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nNow then, these conversion rates seem a bit low in my opinion. When I first started, I was thinking that this idea could at least have a 15% (of people who land on the page, sign-up for early access) conversion rate. On the other hand, the survey largely confirms my understanding of the problems and the expected solutions.\\n\\nSo, I am now in the uncomfortable situation of not knowing whether to move forward with the development and potentially fail or to just shelve it and move on and potentially regret it.\\n\\nI\\'m a business guy by day but I\\'m also a Software Engineer by education, I\\'ve got strong web skills, backend and frontend. As for mobile, I\\'m currently learning a framework that could allow me to build a MVP. I estimate the dev effort to be around 4 months working evenings and weekends exclusively on this. Or, 8 months if I continue setting-up and testing other ideas I have.\\n\\nThat said, I honestly don\\'t want to spend that much time building a MVP if there is a way to test this further without actually building it. I would love to hear what you think. Any tips on how to reach a decision? What are the things I should consider or take into account before moving forward?',\n",

You may have a great product or service but if you have no idea when you'll be breaking even { When Total Revenue Earned = Total Costs (Fixed and Variable) }, then most investors will hesitate to fund you. As the CEO of your company, you should make sure you have this important detail in your business plan.

If our Fixed Costs are 100,000, our Selling Price Per Unit is 1500 and our Variable Costs are 500, then our Break Even will be\\n\\n100,000 / (1500 - 500) = 100\\n\\nThis means we have to sell 100 shoes before we make our first profit.\\n\\nThis is information that gives the investor confidence that there's a return on investment.\\n\\nWould love to hear more from your experiences.

I work full time and expressed my limited availability in the interview, which was not a concern for them. I was also offered stocks in lieu of pay, which was fine for me as well.\\n\\nA few months in and the projects they give me definitely take longer than 10 hours a week. The work involves reviewing databases with thousands of items--it's just not possible to have the quick turn around times they want without working on the projects around the clock, which is not possible working full time. I later asked one of the managers how many hours per week are expected for my management level role, and she said that their (unpaid) student interns often put in 25+ hours, implying that I should expect the same.\\n\\nThe stock equity doesn't vest until 2 years of working with them. I do not know if I can see myself working this much for that long.

       "  'I run a podcast about fundraising for early stage startups and I\\'ve conducted nearly 200 interviews with angel investors, VCs and successful founders and created a list of the major terms/acronyms that they are using. Here it is.\\n\\n**1. VC - venture capital - most frequently meaning venture capitalist or**  \\n**venture capital firm.**  \\nPutting aside the official definition of Wikipedia, when someone says “VC”  \\nthey usually mean Venture Capital firm - investment organization that  \\ninvests in Seed+ stages. If someone at the Pre-Seed stage is saying “We  \\nare talking to a lot of VCs” they are right - they are just talking. VCs rarely  \\njoin pre-seed rounds, so don’t spend much time reaching out to them  \\nunless you have great metrics to show them, try reaching out to angel  \\ninvestors instead.\\n\\n**2. CAC - customer acquisition cost.**  \\nSo this is the amount of money spent on acquiring one customer. It can be  \\neasily calculated by dividing all money spent on this issue by the number of  \\ncustomers you really got. So to calculate my Google Ads CAC I’ll divide the  \\nbudget spent on Google Ads by the number of customers it brought me.\\n\\n**3. CPC - cost per click.**  \\nThis is basically the amount of money you have to pay your advertiser for each  \\nclick. Facebook and google ads provide this metric, but just so you know -  \\nto calculate CPC you need to divide the budget of the ad on the number  \\nof clicks your ad got.\\n\\n**4. LTV - lifetime value.**\\n\\nWhich is a gross income you get from working with one client. The  \\ndescription for LTV calculation is a bit long and complicated, so click here  \\nif you want to understand how to calculate LTV.\\n\\n**5. MRR - monthly recurring revenue.**  \\nIn other words MRR measures how much revenue you generate in a  \\nmonth. MRR is very important because investors look for its steady  \\ngrowth. One of the most frequent things we hear while talking to Seed-  \\nstage investors is: “MRR has to be growing 10-20% Month Over Month if  \\nyou want me to invest”. That’s why you should focus on MRR so much.\\n\\n**6. ARR - annual recurring revenue.**  \\nBasically the same as MRR but for the year. Important only at Seed,  \\nSeries A+ stages where VCs are trying to see if the company is big  \\nenough for them. If you are an early stage startup, don’t worry about it.\\n\\n**7. SaaS - software as a service.**  \\nWhich means providing a customer with an already licensed and hosted by  \\nprovider software on a subscription basis. The main advantage of this service is  \\nthat you do not need to pay for creating and installing software.\\n\\n**8. B2C - business to consumer.**  \\nThis term mostly refers to such type of commerce which specialise at direct  \\nselling between business and an individual consumer. An example would be  \\nNetflix, that drives most of its profits from individual consumers.\\n\\n**9. B2B - business to business.**  \\nThis is the type of business that sells products and services to other  \\nbusinesses. An example of a B2B startup would be Unity Technologies,  \\nwhose main customers are other companies.\\n\\n**10. R&D - research and development.**  \\nR&D is basically the efforts that a company makes to create something  \\ninnovative and give itself some competitive advantage.\\n\\nThe primary reason for why I decided to start sharing with the \"startups\" and similar subreddits is to understand what early stage founders really want to hear about. So if you are an early stage founder and you found this article helpful, please let me know what else would you like to know about fundraising for startups!',\n",

However, as we\\'ve grown, it\\'s caused a lot of confusion. People definitely go to hire\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_.com instead, and then see a dusty site that was never finished, and write us off.\\n\\nOver the years, I\\'ve reached out several times to the owners.

Here is what we propose.Just this year porno.com sold for 8.8 million dollars. The good domain name is still king.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>We are not selling a domain we are selling a venue space for your business to get a good foothold. Like a national commercial a perfect domain name is a critical way for a company like yours to get its name out there. Commercials (ad space) as we all know are not cheap. For example a 30 second spot during the super bowl runs 4.5 million. Now we are not saying that we are the super bowl but we aren\\'t asking 4.5 million for a half minute.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Okay okay. You might be worried about where this is going. Fear not. We are also a group of creatives trying to make things happen. We can make it work at a fraction of the cost for you to rent the domain with the ability to purchase it after 2 years so if things don\\'t work out that is all good you have the option to not buy after 2 years.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>We feel the domain is worth somewhere in the 3.75 million dollar price point. Wow less than 30 seconds for a superbowl ad.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>We don\\'t expect you to pay this up front. As we discussed you want to start lean then purchase in a price point that we are asking for when the company is a huge success!  \\n  \\n>  \\n>\\\\[name\\\\] and I discussed allowing rental of the domain on a monthly basis for 2 years then after those two years you can purchase the domain for the 3.75 million price point. This allows you a good period of time to get your operations up and running. Also we don\\'t use or sell the domain to anyone else for the 2 years. This exclusive arrangement requires us a reasonable monthly stipend for \\\\[our company\\\\] to not sell it to other interested parties.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>We can give you 2 options.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>A monthly option at $50,000 a month. This allows you to drop at any time for the 2 year span before the requirement of purchase. If you do 3 months and it doesn\\'t work you can walk away no problem.  \\nA yearly option at $35,000 a month. You will be required to pay for the year with a discounted rate. You are buying not only the rent but us not being able to use the domain for the remainder of the purchased usage.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>So for around $600,000-$420,000 a year you will get a great domain and a way to not pay up front for it\\'s usage.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>If this is something you want to engage us in we will have our lawyer draft up a contract.We appreciate the opportunity.

As such, nobody cares about your opinion. What counts is the feedback of the market on your idea.\\n\\n**2. Embrace the competition**\\n\\n**A. Find your competitors -**  Limit yourself to 5-10 competitors. Research of G2, Capterra, Alternativeto, etc. Talk to industry experts and hear their opinion about the problem you\\'re solving and understand how they solve it without your solution (they most probably use a manual approach or a competitor).\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have any direct or indirect competitor, go back to step 1. \\n\\n**B.**  **What are the killer features of your competitors?** \\\\- List the top 10 features of each of your competitors. Keep the top 3 features. Focus on how to achieve them in a better way. \\n\\n**C. How do they communicate their Value-Proposition?** One of the most difficult tasks is conveying the right message to the customer. They must understand directly what your product is about and how you can help them to solve their problem. Get inspired by the competition, and aggregate everything in word clusters.\\n\\n**D. Identify the flaws of your competitors -** Try their product. Check customer reviews (g2, capterra, etc). Talk with their sales team and customer support. Understand why their customers are choosing them over other competitors. Discover inefficiencies in their product. \\n\\n**3. Innovate - Talk with customers**\\n\\n**A. Contact the right people -** Experts in the industry, key stakeholders at companies. Pretend you\\'re making a press article or a blog contribution about them. They will be more likely to talk with you.\\n\\n**B**. **Ask them the right questions -** Try to be as neutral as possible. Don\\'t talk too much while interviewing them (you must talk at most during 20% of the conversation). Don\\'t ask questions for the sole goal of having the confirmation you\\'re right about a topic. Show them a path, and let them talk about their frustrations.  \\n\\n**C. Understand how they currently solve the problem -** How do they deal with the problem that would potentially be solved by your solution? Do they use one of your future competitors? Why did they choose that solution over another? What they like about the solution they\\'re currently using, and what they don’t like?\\n\\n**4. Your buyer persona**\\n\\nWho will, in the end, use your product? Who is the key stakeholder that will validate the purchase of your solution and who will actually use it? (i.e: a CFO is not the buyer persona of a marketing solution). What is their budget allocated to solve the problem they are encountering? What kind of companies are you targeting (Startups, SMEs, Corporate)?  \\nWho would not buy your product?\\n\\n**5. Put your idea into words**\\n\\nThis one is a difficult one. Fill this famous sentence:\\n\\nWe help {target audience} to {problem you\\'re solving} by {your solution}.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nDon\\'t hesitate to share your experience and we can talk about it! \\n\\nGood luck to all of you,\\n\\nFranz.',\n",
       "  'Hello all, I recently left a business that I co-founded so that I could create a new company. The company I left is very successful, I can proudly use that company as a reference to potential lenders / investors. Unfortunately I didn’t have a big cash out, so I don’t sit with much cash to start my new venture. I am estimating that I will need $75,000 year 1, $50,000 year 2 and potentially $50,000 in year 3. \\n\\nThat $$ would go towards R&D, materials, marketing, trade show attendance, production and a staff of two employees. I would not be taking pay from the company until it is profitable. \\n\\nHere are some details about my new venture :\\n\\n1. It will be retail company selling a physical product. \\n2. My product will have innovations that will make it unique in the market. \\n3. It will be in the same industry that I left, so I will be starting my new business with over 8 years of proven success. \\n4. I already have a large portfolio of buyers whom I have collected over 8 years of networking in my industry. These buyers would be loyal to me. \\n5. I own a house with about $100000-$150000 in equity which I can use as collateral. \\n6. I have another real estate asset I can also use as collateral if needed. \\n\\nSo far here are the 5 methods of startup funding I have seen : \\n\\n1. Angel Investor \\n2. Friends / Family \\n3. Cloud Funding\\n4. SBA\\n5. Traditional Bank Loan \\n\\n- I personally would like to eliminate option 2, I have not had the best experience with friends and family. Too much emotion involved \\n\\n- The SBA sounds attractive, but I have been hearing mixed things.

       "  'Your product offers a free trial but your users aren\\'t converting when it expires?\\n\\nMost of the time the worst part is that you don\\'t have any data to figure out why users stopped using your product. Even if you reach out, feedback is usually sparse and often doesn\\'t reveal any useful patterns you can look into.\\n\\nIn response to that, a lot of time and energy is usually spent tweaking the onboarding flow or marketing funnel.\\n\\nBut there\\'s a simpler, better way to increase your conversion rates. Let\\'s see how it works.\\n\\n## Why a free trial is a hard sell\\nThere\\'s a lot of debate whether having a free trial is the best way to acquire new customers.\\n\\nThe clear upside of offering a free trial is that the barrier of entry is extremely low. An E-Mail address and a password is usually enough to get new users into the door. The more users you have onboarded, the more likely it is that they talk about your product in their peer groups and network (assuming it solves a real pain). Even better if your product has built-in functionalities which incentivize your users to invite others. This mix of Word-of-Mouth and network effects kick-starts the growth flywheel which will attract even more users. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\nEventually a small percentage of your overall user base converts and upgrades to a paid plan.\\n\\nHundreds of large-scale companies followed this exact playbook. Given their success it should be a no-brainer to follow this strategy as well, correct?\\n\\nDespite the aforementioned upsides there are also clear downsides to this approach. Having more users usually translates into more customer support requests your support staff needs to handle. In addition to that it\\'s tricky to get the math right such that you can use the revenue you generate via your paid plans to finance the resources and infrastructure necessary for your free trials.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a clear, definite answer whether you should offer a free trial or avoid it at all costs. At the end of the day it all comes down to the type of product you sell and the audience you\\'re serving.\\n\\nRegardless of the way you acquire new customers there\\'s one metric you should monitor closely when onboarding new users: User engagement.\\n\\n## The core problem with free trials\\nLow user engagement is at the very core of problems related to free trials.\\n\\nGiven that one only needs an E-Mail address and a password to sign up for your product it\\'s an easy decision to take the leap and give it a try. Testing it is free after all and who doesn\\'t like getting something for free?\\n\\nThe issue is that finding the time to sit down and \"work with it in the next couple of days\" usually never materializes. Life gets in the way and sooner rather than later the trial expires and your users are locked-out, never to be seen again.\\n\\nSure, this isn\\'t always the case but more often than not people just don\\'t get around testing your product enough to uncover the benefits they\\'ll experience when using it in their day-to-day to solve their problems.\\n\\n## Free plans and \"asking for the credit card upfront\"\\nOne solution to mitigate this problem is to offer a limited, \"always free\" plan. This way users will have enough time to tinker around and assess whether your product is worth its money. But this only kicks the can down the road as you\\'ll likely face the same issue of low user engagement as before. In addition to that you open up a can of worms because now you have to deal with all the other challenges a free plan entails:\\n\\n- Even more customer support\\n- Figuring out what to offer in the free plan and what to put in the paid plans\\n- Ways to incentivize powers users of your \"always free\" plan to upgrade\\n- Increasing spent on infrastructure and other resources\\n- ...\\n\\nAnother common strategy to solve the free trial dilemma is to \"ask for the credit card upfront\", meaning that users have to put in their credit card information when they sign up but they won\\'t be charged after their trial expired. While asking for credit card information is a good way to filter out users who might never convert into paid customers it comes with the sames problems we just discussed.\\n\\nOffering an \"always free\" plan or asking for the credit card upfront still doesn\\'t solve the issue of low user engagement.\\n\\n## How to solve the user engagement debacle\\nNow that we know why free trials and free plans are a tough sell it\\'s time to tackle the underlying issue: Low user engagement.\\n\\nBasic human psychology tells us that human beings value items more if they\\'ve spent money to acquire them. Think about the last time you got something for free vs. the time you spent money on a similar item. Chances are that you\\'ve used and valued the item you paid money for more.\\n\\nThis discovery can be used to inform the way how you can design your trial version to eventually convert more users into paying customers.\\n\\nRather than offering a free trial which expires in 30 days offer a paid version of that exact same trial.\\n\\nYes, you read that right. Turn your free trial into a paid trial.\\n\\n## The benefits of a paid trial\\nOffering a paid trial comes with a couple of major advantages:\\n\\n1. Only users who are seriously considering your product will sign up for the paid trial\\n1. It\\'s more likely that your users will find the time to test your product because they paid for it\\n1. Your users value your product more compared to your competitors who offer a free plan / free trial\\n1. Your users are more committed to get the most value out of your product during the trial\\n1. Another huge point of friction is already removed from the conversion process (asking to put in the credit card information and subscribe to a paid plan)\\n\\nIn fact I learned about the power a paid plan can have from a personal experience. Given my growing interest in SEM, SEO and marketing in general I did some research to figure out what tools the market has to offer in that space.\\n\\nIn particular I was looking for a tool which would help me conducting Keyword Research, Backlink analysis and SEO monitoring. What I stumbled upon was the well-known tool Ahrefs.\\n\\nHowever what struck me was that compared to their competitors their pricing structure was different. There was no \"Free trial\". I had to pay 7 USD to get access to the tool for 7 days. After some hesitation I decided to give it a shot and try it for the next 7 days. Needless to say that I used Ahrefs every single day during that week. The felt \"pressure\" to get the most out of the 7 days in combination with their excellent, educational E-Mail sequence helped me to explore all the values their tool has to offer. I\\'m absolutely certain that their conversion rates from paid trial to paying customer aren\\'t too shabby.\\n\\n## Your challenge\\nDo you have a free plan, free trial or are thinking about introducing such a plan in the near future?\\n\\nI\\'d challenge you to take a step back and think about offering a paid trial instead. Your paid trial shouldn\\'t be too expensive but it should be enough that your users are incentivized to explore your product in more depth. Combine your paid trial with a helpful, educational E-Mail onboarding sequence and check-in with your users every now and then to understand what their problems are and to help them succeed.\\n\\nI\\'m certain that this will help you tackle any conversion-related problems you might be facing!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nConverting users you\\'ve attracted via a free trial or a free plan to become paying customers is hard. There are a couple of issues one has to be aware of. It\\'s tough to get the math right and take the profits you made from your paid plans to offset the costs you\\'ll introduce by offering a free plan / free trial. While it\\'s highly likely that you\\'ll get new users using your product you\\'ll also experience an increase in customer support requests and an almost guaranteed low conversion rate.\\n\\nOne of the underlying core problem with all this is a lack of user engagement. Paid products are valued more than free ones.\\n\\nYou can use this fact and offer a paid trial which incentivizes your users to take action and explore the values your product has to offer. Having a more engaged user base helps you tackle the conversion-related problems you might be facing.\\n\\n[Originally published at philippmuens.com](https://philippmuens.com/how-to-convert-more-users-when-their-trial-expires/)',\n",

       "  \"I bet everyone here had that overwhelming experience having too many things to do. So many that only the thought about it makes you anxious. And instead of doing something, you procrastinate and watch videos on YouTube.\\n\\nI was that person. It's so hard to get yourself out of this state and start working. That's why I wanted to share my experience on how you can deal with an overwhelming amount of tasks. And hopefully, helping someone.\\n\\nFirst, you need a place where you can write down every task and thought/idea. Paper notes and note apps don't work - you'll see why. I highly recommend using Trello for a number of reasons (described below).\\n\\n## The question\\n\\nThe question is how to cheat your brain in the first place. He's the main reason why you're overwhelmed and why you're procrastinating. You need to realize that your brain **LOVES** it when something it's easy to do. The less power to use, the better.\\n\\nOnce you fool him and you start some action (like writing tasks down) then it becomes easier because you're in charge, not your brain. When you start writing TODOs and your brain sees that it's not that hard to use Trello (and it's actually enjoyable) he will let you go instead of procrastinating.\\n\\n## Steps for your brain\\n\\n## Step 1:\\n\\nTo your brain: I'm just gonna download that Trello app and create an account. It's an easy thing to do.\\n\\n## Step 2:\\n\\nCreate just one board and name it: ***My Company TODOs*** and then create 4 lists\\n\\n* Backlog (everything you need to do)\\n* TODOs (the tasks that need to be done - it's the right time for them)\\n* In Progress\\n* Done\\n\\n## Step 3:\\n\\nTrello is great cuz you have labels with colors (our brain loves it when it's colorful cuz it's easy). Use the labels and create the main categories that you will use later. For me they were: Marketing, Finance, Sales & BD, Dev\\n\\n## Step 4:\\n\\nStart writing everything that comes to your mind in different cards in the Backlog list. Just let it out - everything. Use each card to add more info if needed - links, description, checklist, comments, etc. When you're done start adding labels to each card.\\n\\n## Step 4.1\\n\\nAt some point (as it was for me) you might have too many tasks for one board and it becomes overwhelming again. In this case, it's time to create boards based on your main categories (labels) and move each task. Because each category had a color, you can use the same color (or image with that color) as a background for your new board. Again, it's colorful - something your brain likes.\\n\\n## Step 5\\n\\nOnce you have all tasks you need goals. I repeat: Once you have all tasks you need goals! But why? Well, if you have four goals:\\n\\n1. Getting a client until the end of the month (10 tasks)\\n2. Writing a blog post (7 tasks)\\n3. Designing a new website page (12 tasks)\\n4. Making industry research (6 tasks)\\n\\n...and you need money - which one of the four tasks is the most important? Of course, it's number 1. You're starting prioritizing tasks. Now, instead of 35 tasks (total), your brain needs to focus only on 10. You guessed it - he loves that.\\n\\n## A side note\\n\\nWhen you start working and closing tasks you'll start feeling better. It's because you're seeing progress and results. It motivates you which will probably boost your productivity and clear your mind instead of being stressed and anxious.\",\n",

But this is pretty normal and I don't think represents risk.\\n\\n\\\\- He is a talented developer with a lot of potential and also for a software guy has a good business mind, which is valuable.\\n\\n\\\\- The downside to this huge potential is that I don't expect him to stick around until exit, so I want to make sure I don't give away 10% of my company to someone who will leave in 2 years.\\n\\n**Maybe it could be a potential of milestone and time based vesting? Does anyone have any good tips for coming up with a good equity deal without too much risk?**\\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\",\n",

       "  'TikTok is an app that was designed exclusively for engagement. It\\'s an interesting case study for anyone who wants to build an engaging product with high growth. I have spent more than 20h analyzing it. Here is a summary of 7 lessons I learned from its addictive design.\\n\\n# 1. Build An Influencer Economy\\n\\nTikTok designed an alternative economy were your views are like your wealth. And that wealth is spread between users similarly to how money is spread in the world.\\n\\nThe top 1% have most of it. They are the faces of the app. They inspire others to become creators and follow that path. They look like average everyday people who were able to achieve massive success, so it makes you believe \"if they did, then maybe I can do it too\".\\n\\nThis pushes the masses to participate in the economy and try to win. Even if the majority of them will stay  \"poor\" or \"middle class\", seeing the top 1% gives them the motivation to continue.\\n\\nBut only 1% reach that success, the rest of the users are \"poor\" or \"middle class\". They don\\'t get as many views and followers. They are more like consumers, they drive all the traffic that the top 1% collects, and they produce content in the hope of joining that 1% one day. For TikTok it\\'s great, they created an economy where everyone wants to participate and everyone wants to win.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: To get large engagement, create an economy where people are inspired by the top users, and the wealth is represented by your engagement metric.**\\n\\n# 2. Optimize For The Power Users\\n\\nNow, in an economy, not everyone participates the same way. You have to identify the power users, those who will be the most active members of the economy.\\n\\nIf you look at TikTok\\'s audience, you notice that it\\'s much younger than all the other social media. And there is a reason for that. Kids and teenagers are in quest of attention. They are very impressionable, they are easier to influence, they pick up trends faster, and most importantly they are very active online. TikTok identified that and optimized for it.\\n\\nThat\\'s why the most popular users (the \"top 1%\" that TikTok promotes) are all mostly teenagers between 14 and 18 years old. They are the stars who are supposed to inspire this community of power users.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: Find the most active users of your economy and optimize for them.**\\n\\nOne thing I would like to mention here is the ethics of targeting a young audience. The younger your audience is, the more responsibility you have to carry. I don\\'t really see TikTok trying to promote a healthy culture on the platform. A lot of it is very superficial, and if you combine the addictive design with young developing brains, you have a dangerous combination. If TikTok wanted to change that, it\\'s simple, just change the top 1% you promote. If the top users would inspire these kids to be better versions of themselves, to learn more, to stay healthy, exercise, etc. that would change the whole culture of the platform. Issue here is that this wouldn\\'t get as much engagement, which is the primary focus of TikTok, so you have to make a decision between profits and the legacy you want to leave for humanity.\\n\\n# 3. Personalize The User Experience\\n\\nTikTok uses a very powerful AI to recommend you new content. It\\'s like an entertainment slot machine where you are always winning something.\\n\\nWhen you open the app, you get a new random video each time, and the more you spend on the app, the better these suggestions get. It personalizes to you.\\n\\nThe common challenge with AI is getting good data. We already have the algorithms, but getting the data is the hard part. This is what TikTok was able to crack. Instead of presenting a list of recommendations (like YouTube, Netflix or Instagram does), TikTok infers what it thinks you will like and directly shows it to you. Then based on how you react: if you like the video, follow the creator, watch it until the end, or swipe away, they know with much more accuracy the type of content you enjoy.\\n\\nOn YouTube for example, there are a lot of factors beyond the video itself that influences if a person even clicks on it (like the thumbnail, the title, the number of views, who the creator is), so if someone doesn\\'t click on a video, that doesn\\'t tell you if they would have liked it or not. Because of that your data to make recommendations isn\\'t as accurate.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: Personalize the experience by collecting the most relevant data you can.**\\n\\n# 4. Create Bite-Sized Interaction\\n\\nHuman\\'s attention span is short. You only have a few seconds to grab someone\\'s attention. On the web, the rule is that when visitors land on your website, you have less than 15 seconds to get their interest.\\n\\nOh wait, but TikTok videos are also around 15 seconds long. Is it a coincidence?\\n\\nProbably not. This is engineered to keep your brain stimulated. You get a dopamine hit each time you watch these short videos. That\\'s part of the reason why it\\'s so addictive.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: Create bit-sized interactions to keep your users engaged!**\\n\\n# 5. Bring Real Value To Your Users\\n\\nA key component that people often forget when they think about engagement, is that at the end of the day, you have to remember the big picture, which is to bring value to your users.\\n\\nTikTok doesn\\'t really do that, in fact it might be the opposite, it takes your time away and doesn\\'t give you much in return. You might argue that it doesn\\'t matter as long as your business is growing. The reality is that there is a business reason for bringing value as well. Simply put: people don\\'t stay on a platform that damages them for long. If users are stuck in the app and it starts to negatively impact their lives, they will leave as soon as they got the chance, and when they do, they will feel a lot better.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: When you create an engaging design, don\\'t forget to bring real value to your users, otherwise you will become an addictive product they will want to get rid of.**\\n\\n# 6. Make It As Easy As Possible For Your Users To Participate\\n\\nThere are two ways to participate on TikTok: you watch content or you create content.\\n\\nThe easier these 2 things are, the more people will do them. That\\'s why when you look at the app, literally everything is made to make it as easy as possible.\\n\\nTo watch content, you don\\'t even have to click anywhere, you don\\'t have to make a decision. Unlike on YouTube, you don\\'t have to look at the thumbnails or the number of views to decide if you should watch it, **it\\'s all done for you**. The app presents you the videos it thinks you should watch, and you just swipe through them.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: Make it as easy as possible for your users to participate!**\\n\\n# 7. Empower Your Users To Generate Content For You\\n\\nNow to create the content, again TikTok makes it super easy. They provide a range of creative tools and fancy effects. The video format is short too, which by itself makes it faster to create. You spend a few minutes to shoot the video, and then a couple of minutes to edit it in the app. That\\'s it, you are done!\\n\\nThe algorithm will then help you quickly get views, so you have that instant gratification. More views are generated on TikTok compared to other platforms, because the videos are so short. On average, in a day, people end up watching somewhere around 200 to 300 videos, compared to YouTube where you will probably watch maybe 10 videos max.\\n\\n➜ **THE LESSON: Encourage user-generated content by empowering users and making it super simple for them!**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this! I have made [this video](https://youtu.be/XGiPFYZRZwE) where I dive deeper into TikTok and breakdown everything step by step (took my 30h to make lol).

       "  \"\\\\[BACKGROUND\\\\]\\n\\nI am running a profitable company that was bootstrapped with $100k of my own money. I do not plan to sell the company and never had an exit strategy. In the early stage of the company with no traction, I've approached an all-star developer to be a part of the company and he ended up declining. Eventually, I was able to get him on board after generating traction and revenue. We settled at 10% profit sharing since he already has a full-time job and he is just working on the side. We also negotiated profit sharing increase to 20% once business reaches a certain milestone. The main reason I was focused on him was because we work really well together. I value compatibility more than anything.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\[CURRENT\\\\]\\n\\nHe enhanced and implemented new features for the business under my direction. He isn't involved on the operation's side due to his full-time job so it is mostly me that wants new things added on to streamline our operations . The business is really taking off and we are now looking into decent 6 figure profit for the company. There is 2 of us so his share is not small given the time he has put into the company.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\[ISSUE\\\\]\\n\\nHe now wants 30% of profit sharing due to the value he was able to bring. I do want to OK this but this one is a bit tough for me.  It wasn't an idea that I presented to him, the product already had traction and was generating revenue. I took the risk of time and money from the beginning (I didn't get paid in the last 2 years and everything went back into the business.) I've traveled around the country to meet new potential clients, I've built a network of industry connections, etc. At the end, it's my vision, my strategy & my product. \\n\\nI know the question might be different since we are talking about profit sharing and not equity. Is 30% profit sharing too much for a CTO that is part-time? I can't quantify value or put a dollar figure to it and I factor in time spent, risk took, etc. and his share feels more than enough to be compensated while working full-time else where. \\\\*\\\\*ADDED \\\\*\\\\* I do want to point out that there were times when things got delayed and there's still new features yet to be implemented because he is busy from his day job. So people who are saying his full-time job elsewhere is irrelevant - Yes, I agree it is irrelevant if things get done on time as promised, etc. If it's impacting the business then it's something that needs to be mentioned.   \\n\\n\\nI can offer him equity of the company so he can be motivated to grow the company together but it won't do him any good since I won't be selling the company. I can still offer it to him though.\",\n",

       "  'Hi,\\n\\nI founded a startup around 6 months ago with some individuals from India. Over those six months we registered our company as a legal entity in India (LLP) and along with this, we were told each that our details have been forwarded for \\'Registation\\' by the CEO so that we can get equal equity. \\n\\nThis was 2 months ago. Every time I\\'ve asked for an update, or mention that it\\'s been a while, I get shot down by the CEO who keeps saying that because of COVID-19, there are \\'delays\\'. To me this sounds like an excuse. \\n\\nI was investing in my slice of expenses until 3-4 months ago. What happened was that the CEO purchased some services such as Instagram Ads which me and one other co-founder was not made aware of.  I brought this up to the CEO who lost his cool, saying that I should not be questioning these purchases since they did not fall under my supervision and that as a co-founder I must pay for it, since, according to him, I am a co-founder. However these words are meaningless if I do not hold equity, and there are clear operational issues here as they\\'re trying to force money out of me for purchases I have had no say in.\\n\\nFurthermore, when we first launched, the CEO, who apparently started the legal process of creating a LLP told me that because I am from the UK, I will need to register as a co-founder a couple months later as it will add complexities to the amount of money that we can initially invest. He told me that his lawyer showed him the \\'relevant law\\'. \\n\\nSmelling bullshit, I asked him multiple times to show me the legislation so that I can try and sort things out from my side, or that I can understand the situation more. It has been 5 months and he keeps shooting my request down, recently telling me that \"It\\'s not a big deal\". I feel like he lied simply because he wants more equity for himself. This was made apparent later, when he said that he\\'s forwarded our details for registration. So suddenly this is no longer an issue. \\n\\nFast track to today, we have more expenses coming up. I still have no proof of equity after 6 months of operation, and 2 co-founders have just left for personal reasons. I will be quitting in the next couple weeks. Nobody has seen a shred of evidence that they have equity. \\n\\nNow those co-founders (and I) are being asked to pay for the purchases (total cost / 6 founders), which is around £150 each, even though we are quitting, and have never had equity. \\n\\nI feel like the CEO has simply delayed in registering co-founder details for equity since it has been months, and in addition there is no legally binding agreement between us. It appears that he has been delaying to get free work out of the other co-founders and I, and to get our money.\\n\\nI have been paid for some purchases in the past. When it was clear that this won\\'t be going anywhere, I stopped payments.\\n\\nWe now have our monthly expenses come up. He is trying to get the \\'cofounders\\' who are leaving to pay up, and in addition to this, he said he will be \\'releasing\\' their equity so that there is more for the rest of us. Now I don\\'t know too much about Indian LLP Law, but I\\'m pretty sure that equity cannot be released by any other co-founders. So what hes actually saying that equity has not been locked in yet.\\n\\nI understand that in reality that equity was never there. \\n\\nA) I have never seen a shred of proof regarding equity\\n\\nB) Some purchases were made without my knowledge\\n\\nC) I will be quitting in the next 2 weeks (university starting)\\n\\n\\nSome advice would be really appreciated.

A very creative approach, but I guess it never really worked.  \\nYear defunct: 2008  \\nLocation: California, USA  \\nWhy they failed: No Product Market fit\\n\\n**#9 Amp’d Mobile $407 million invested**  \\nAmp’d Mobile was launched in 2005 as a new mobile phone provider that targeted a younger demographic and featured downloadable and streaming video as well as streamed live events which was all new at the time.  \\n**Year defunct:** 2007  \\n**Location:** California, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** Mismanagement/Bad Decisions\\n\\n**#8 Pay by Touch $427 million invested**  \\nPay By Touch was a payment provider that offered biometric authentication at the point of sale which was supposed to be a low-cost alternative to other payment options.  \\n**Year defunct:** 2007  \\n**Location:** California, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** Mismanagement/Bad Decisions\\n\\n**#7 Webvan $580 million invested**  \\nWebvan was an online grocery store where customers could get products delivered to their homes within a 30-minute window of their choosing.  \\n**Year defunct:** 2001  \\n**Location:** California, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** No Product Market fit\\n\\n**#6 Abound Solar $700 million invested**  \\nAbound Solar was manufacturing thin-film for solar panels.There is not much information about this company online.  \\n**Year defunct:** 2012  \\n**Location:** Colorado, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** No Product Market fit\\n\\n**#5 Theranos $726 million invested**  \\nTheranos was making a blood-testing device that could test you for any disease you can imagine, from only a small drop of blood.  \\n**Year defunct:** 2018  \\n**Location:** California, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** No Product Market fit (+compelling proof of fraud although nobody convicted yet)\\n\\n**#4 Better Place $755 million invested**  \\nBetter Place was building a global network of battery-charging and battery-switching services for electric cars.

Go.com was a Startup inside Disney. I added Go.com to the list as Disney actually made it public how much was invested and lost in Go.com and that amount qualified them for this list! Disney wanted to build a portal that had all the content that Disney provided. Disney also acquired the search engine Infoseek and Infoseek became a part of Go.com  \\n**Year defunct:** 2001  \\n**Location:** California, USA  \\n**Why they failed:** No Product Market fit\\n\\n**#1 Solyndra $1,853 million invested**  \\nSolyndra was a manufacturer of thin-film solar cells.The secret sauce of the product was that they didn’t use polysilicon.

Either they never find a product market fit or there is some mismanagement or bad decisions. In some cases there is both. If you ask, **What is the number one reason startups fail?** It is pretty clear from the biggest startup failures of all time that the number one reason for failure is that **they never get a Product Market fit.**\\n\\nTake Theranos, there clearly was no product market fit, but on top of that some really bad mismanagement and maybe even fraud.\\n\\n# Where Startups Fail (and Win)\\n\\nAnother interesting observation for this group is that they are ALL from the US, not one single Startup from anywhere else in the world made this list.\\n\\nActually, the geography is even more crazy. Not only are they all from the US, but 9 out of 10 are also from California. All 9 are either in the San Francisco Bay Area or Los Angeles, incredible to see 9 out of 10 are from only 2 cities.\\n\\nSure there are some really big losses here in California and you are tempted to think that they make some really bad investments in California. However, California looks bad because this is where most investments are made and there is a willingness to take really big bets here. When you take really big bets you will win some and lose some.

Market research is a need to know, but investors won\\'t be overly impressed that you have an understanding of the market you operate in. Comes with the territory!\\n* Digital Marketing: Cheap & easy. Full-scale marketing can cost thousands, but running a few $5/day ads directed to your landing page and monitoring is cheap. Think through the suite of options including: Social Media, SEO, PPC, blogs, podcasts, email marketing, influencers, and content marketing.\\n* Customer Interviews: Peak validation and completely free. Hard for even the most seasoned investor to argue a problem doesn\\'t exist if you show them +100 confirmatory interviews, surveys, etc. Not every customer engagement is going to be validating, but this isn\\'t about a singular customer.

Room for growth, and upselling, didn't related products, and subscriptions packages with those products etc.\\n\\nBut the second part of my business involves much larger projects. They would be running continuously, but each project start is staggered from the next. Each one is very long term, a completely different beast, and the sales process is very long (years) and highly beuracratic involving super complex contracts with dozens of key players. Negotiations, and more. We can kinda prep to eventually do lower level contracts (under 100k setup costs), but the return on the low level stuff isn't worthwhile. We can't even begin to do any decent return projects until we have a minimum of 350k for our infrastructure / set up for these long haul beasts, and most excellent ones we want to be at way down the line will cost us infrastructure costs and setup upwards of a few million (all in, including salarys, everything necessary without me inflating numbers etc). Note I'm not doing anything new here. This is all typical for my industry. \\n\\nThe first side of the day to day operations, of the typical products/sales process, is essentially funding the second one. This keeps the lights on and the doors open. It gets us up in the morning. We are, just starting anyways and nowhere near amassing enough. So, I want to boost this second side with funding. Huge returns if we do it right.\\n\\nIdeally i want a pool of investors that get something akin to dividends, if we make money on those projects they do. But not equity. Or am I calling it the wrong thing. The more I collect the more diversified we can be in those huge arenas. We can't promise we will succeed though either. But we really don't want to do equity shares or convertible notes etc, these people will be funding projects not giving money to the company for equity or shares or seats. We aren't doing another round, we are doing continuous fund collections for this and we hope our success and results gain additional investors.\\n\\nWhat other financial instruments are there? Am i overlooking things? Are we really just collecting money, creating a pool and contracts for each person dictating risk? Are we opening ourselves as a mutual fund kinda things and need to be beholden to those financial regulatory thing and I'm just calling it something else?

       "  \"This post is based on a conversation I had with Henrik Rosendahl who has multiple exits behind him. If you prefer to see it as a video instead it is available [here](https://youtu.be/aPGhJF3zFGc).\\n\\nHere are the tips and learnings from a founder that has done 5 fast exits with 3 of them very successful. He has sold companies to Cisco, IBM, VMWare, Quantum and others.\\n\\n**Tip #1 Begin with the end**\\n\\nThink about **who would buy the business and why?** Who would benefit the most from buying the company? Listen carefully to the early customers and let them tell you how you fit into the wider ecosystem, Engage with the potential buyers early, not to sell the company, but rather to integrate with them and better understand if you’re on the right track.\\n\\n**Tip  #2 Solve a real problem**\\n\\nRelease early, validate, improve, and expand the product. Focus everything on the core problem and unique IP/technology, don’t boil the ocean. **Get the product out there!**\\n\\n**Tip #3 Buyers are looking for technology, talent, and proof, not revenue**\\n\\nTypical acquirers are looking to add new capabilities to their existing portfolio and people who have the expertise in that area. They want to make sure your technology works in their customers' environment - preferably already integrated into their platform. A little bit of revenue is good proof, but a lot of revenue can make a transaction more complicated and doesn’t matter for a big acquirer.\\n\\n**Tip #4 Have a real business model from day one**\\n\\nGet real money from real customers solving real problems, it is proof for a potential buyer. Basically sell the same product to multiple customers solving the same problem.\\n\\n**Tip #5 B2B is a lot easier than B2C**\\n\\nB2C expensive to grow, it is hit and miss, timing and luck play too big a role. B2C is overall very risky. It can take years of a free product before a business model is even introduced (Tip #4 not possible).\\n\\n**Tip #6 Venture Capitalists are not your friends**\\n\\nMost startups are sold for $25 to $100 million after 24-48 months, this is not interesting for VCs, Raise money according to that. Raise $1-3 million, don’t raise an A-round it will require a +$100 million exit. Understand how VCs make money so you understand their playbook\\n\\n**Tip #7 Go for the Tuck-In Acquisition**\\n\\nThere are 3 kinds of acquisitions:\\n\\n* Strategic Acquisitions\\n* Tuck-In acquisitions\\n* Acquihire\\n\\nYou always hear about the strategic acquisitions usually over $1 billion, but they are very rare and typically propels the buyer into a new market/technology.  Most transactions in the $25 to $100 million range are tuck-ins - an addition of features to an existing platform, this the most likely and best acquisition for a fast exit. Finally, the acquihire - a way to hire a team with a certain expertise.\\n\\n**Tip #8 Be an easy target not a complicated target**\\n\\nWhat to do:\\n\\n* Get good legal help from day one to make sure everything is in order.\\n* Have a savvy CPA/Accountant early on.\\n* Have an HR Strategy that makes people stay on.\\n\\nWhat **not to do**:\\n\\n* Don’t incorporate overseas\\n* Don’t have a distributed team\\n* Don’t do part-time work inside another employer\\n\\nPlease let me know what you think and if you have other tips for a fast exit!\",\n",

       "  'Working on your business and delivering value is important but how do you get the word out and your product in front of your target audience? The answer to this question is marketing.\\n\\nOftentimes marketing is considered to be something that should better be outsourced to an agency or freelancer. Learning just enough marketing to be dangerous takes time and effort. Plus it\\'s tough to figure out where to start. Should you try Google Ads and PPC to drive more traffic? How do they compare to Facebook Ads? Isn\\'t it more powerful to leverage Content Marketing these days? What are the best channels you can use to reach your future customers?\\n\\nAll those questions usually lead to neglecting the marketing part altogether. If you \"build something amazing, they will come\", right? Probably but most of the time it\\'s a good idea to tap into some marketing channels to connect with your users and showcase them the value your product provides.\\n\\nSo what is a good starting point to get the ball rolling? Is there a time- and resource efficient way to start with product marketing today?\\n\\nYes, there is! Let\\'s explore how you can use your customer support system to inform your product marketing strategy.\\n\\n## Customer Support-driven Marketing\\n\\nChances are that if you\\'re running a product business you\\'re also offering a way for your customers to get support. It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a fully-fledged CRM or your own Gmail inbox. If your customers have a way to send support requests you have everything you need to start your low-effort marketing today!\\n\\nWhat you want to do is to browse through your support queue. Look at all the questions people are asking about your product. Are there patterns or themes you can uncover? Are there any questions that are asked more than once?\\n\\nRather than creating yet another FAQ entry and calling it a day take some time to turn the issue your customer was facing into a fully-fledged blog post. The headline should be a variation of the original question such as \"How do I <Problem> with <Your Product>\". Next up you write a couple of paragraphs describing the problem in depth. After that you create section where you talk about the feature your product offers to solve the problem. This section should be followed by a step-by-step guide on how to solve the aforementioned problem via the feature of your product. Conclude your post and add a clear Call-to-Action (Next steps) such as a link to your sign-up page or a Newsletter subscription box.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the main goal of your post should be to describe the problem and show a way how your product can be used to solve the issue at hand.\\n\\n500 - 1000 words should be more than enough to accomplish this.\\n\\n## The benefits of Customer Support-driven Marketing\\n\\nEvery day millions of people use search engines to find solutions to their problems. Wouldn\\'t it be great if articles about your product show up in the search results when people are already looking for solutions? Using this strategy is a form of Content Marketing which helps you rank for search terms your future customers are using to solve their problems. There\\'s no need to do excessive keyword research because it\\'s highly likely that the content you\\'ll write will naturally include the keywords in question.\\n\\nAnother huge benefit of this approach is that it\\'s comparably \"cheap\" in terms of time- and resource investments. If you take only 30 minutes each day to sit down and turn one support request into a blog post you\\'ll eventually produce dozens of quality blog posts which do not only showcase the values your product provides but also helps you answer similar support requests in the future since you can simply share the article with your customer (if they\\'ll ever come up again).\\n\\nPlus you don\\'t have to hire an agency or freelancer which might be a more expensive option.\\n\\nUsing Customer Support-driven Marketing is a cheap and easy way to get your marketing machinery up- and running today.\\n\\nI hope that this post was helpful for you and demonstrated that starting with marketing doesn\\'t have to be that hard.\\n\\nYou can find the original blog post which goes into more detail and provides an example blog post structure at: [https://philippmuens.com/customer-support-driven-marketing/](https://philippmuens.com/customer-support-driven-marketing/)',\n",

As a single founder, I knew it would be hard to bring someone on board with the situation in our country, the idea excited them but not enough for them to put in the hard work or money.\\n\\nYou must be wondering, maybe it was a terrible idea? My spirit was broken multiple times but I knew it had value. You may also think I should\\'ve looked for the first users since I built it already. Well it isn\\'t that easy, the project\\'s particular industry requires a workforce behind it, think of it as Uber if it launched without on-boarding drivers or with no drivers at all.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to say this without sounding like a pompous douchebag but I blame my country or people whichever way you put it for one reason, the lack of vision.

I take part in the blame because I believe I didn\\'t explain it well or sell it good enough. I noticed my shortcomings and worked on it. Years of iteration (for 1 user, me) currently gives me hope in beating this competition that doesn\\'t even know I exist. I believe I have gained experience by studying the idea, doing surveys, iterating, and by launching twice, both times giving me promising metrics but not being able to sustain it due to the reasons I stated above, a team.\\n\\nThis year I just found a way to launch without any help, self-funded and community-driven, and then I see it, there it was on Product Hunt, by 2 founders. The feedback was amazing, for me I took them all personally without question, I was actually happy because this is something I really wanted to exist, and here it is, backed by investors and funded with 7 figures. This also validated my idea in a way and I couldn\\'t be more happier for them.\\n\\nIf I had a lawyer, I know they would stop me from doing what I\\'d do next, but I still went with it. I emailed them to congratulate them and imply that I had something similar and would love to share my findings/research, they actually have a position open for a Lead who they\\'d love to have to bring in their ideas. I requested for a shot at that position too. It was in Silicon Valley so maybe this COVID situation would let me be considered for remote work too. That\\'s what I told my self, that\\'s what I did.\\n\\nIt\\'s been over 3 weeks now and both founders haven\\'t replied, I have mail tracking so just one of them opened my email.\\n\\nI didn\\'t disclose my findings or links nor did I tell them to lawyer up, I offered help and a consideration for a position which I believe I could do good in.

Theirs? I don\\'t think there is, I searched for it on U.S patent databases and I don\\'t think it\\'s could be deemed as intellectual property in the first place, I could be ignorant about this I really haven\\'t sought legal counselling\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPlease do ask questions, I\\'d love to answer.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: My startup failed after 2 launches and another one with resources and workforce that I don\\'t have just launched right before I wanted to launch a third, final time\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: The other startup is behind a paywall and only limited to the iPhone, mine is free to the users and has a model similar to reddit gold where the content is free but you could still support it.

This machine would allow me to make virtually anything out of metal. I have the programming and running down to a t, I’ve been a machinist for 10 years now and have worked in numerous shops doing every step of the process from quoting to ordering to shipping. Even some marketing. I’d like to see how far I could go just me while leveraging gig workers for tasks that are typically overhead costs. For example a gig worker who is good at finding customers would get a percentage of the job profits ECT. Those kinds of things. I’d like to see just how much can be automated. The Software I will be using is heavily customizable and great for automation. being a single person shop could be the best way to truly uncover just how much in the production stream can be automated. Working in the industry I have seen numerous attempts at automation but with a vast amount of employees, you essentially get to a point where the people who can do the most automation do not, they get to a point where their job is easy but not completely automated, wether subconsciously or consciously. The incentives are just not there. \\n\\nI have multiple customers lined up through service bureaus and one significant customer. \\n\\nSo with the 285k machine Wich needs 10-30% down and will only finance 150k and a 50k loan for all of the startup costs (if I started in my garage or privately purchased a house with an outbuilding) I’m looking at around 350k I need to come up with. Needless to say it is daunting. I have no idea where to go or what to say to whoever I need to go to. I know my skills and I know I can do this. I worked with a tiny family shop of 4 people and I try to be humble about it but in less than 2 years me and one other person the same skill level as me basically made the place into an actual business. We worked out of a 2000sqft pole barn in and when I left we had moved into a 65000sqft facility and had acquired 8 new machines all easily half a million. They consulted me about everything and I’m extremely bitter about the experience because they gave me almost nothing as far as compensation goes. \\n\\nSo I guess what I’m missing is the skills and knowledge of the steps taken before I had got to that tiny shop. How do I find funding? I’ve heard angel investors can have pitfalls if the shop isn’t producing at tech company levels. Should I start an llc or something else. I will say I do want to remove myself almost entirely from the debt risk. I know I’m asking a lot in that respect. Is there any hope for someone like me? It’s been a dream for a long time but now with all the experiences have it feels like this could be real!',\n",

I'm starting to realize talented devs don't work for equity, even if they like the idea, and the chances of finding another partner like my previous CTO are slim to none.  But I'm also mindful that releasing an app requires a lot of dev work to fix bugs which could be a bottomless pit if I just hire a dev to create the app and release it and could just bleed me dry without reaching a monetization stage, which could be who knows how far away.\\n\\nAs a non-technical founder, I've been working on an app for a specific market for the past 12 months.  Started with market validation, prototype, searched and found an amazing CTO/co-founder who believed in the mission, released alpha and were close to releasing beta.  All the while, I've been successfully growing the brand, gathering 1000 people who signed up to be beta testers and creating genuine excitement, buzz and support from the target community to the point where they are starting to make posts on Reddit and talk about it online.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my CTO abruptly had to leave the project due to unforeseen family circumstances and I'm left with an app that's near beta completion stage.  \\n\\nI've tried searching for a new CTO/co-founder and though there is a lot of interest, it gets harder and harder every time I draw from the well, and I've tried pretty extensively in the community.  The other option is to hire a freelancer through Fiverr or Upwork and go that route.  But I just don't know if entrepreneurs who end up hiring a freelance dev and pouring their own money into building an app ever succeed because it so much more than just building a releasing an app, it's about maintaining it, iterating, pivoting, etc.  And my app certainly won't be ready for monetization until 6 months after the beta release if we're ambitious.\\n\\nWhat do those with more knowledge and experience say about solo non-technical entrepreneurs who try to release a product without a technical co-founder and opts to hire a freelancer?  Does it ever work out?\\n\\nThanks.\",\n",

       "  \"Hello world.\\n\\nA little over a year ago I came up with an idea that over time with a few revised thoughts and refinement I finally came to a concrete way to build on that foundational vision. Merging two things I dedicate most of my time with being environment and technology I wanted to make a difference in the world. Seeing people like Boyan Slatt and Dave Hakkens and how their dedication towards making the world a better place I knew I wasn't far off. With every passing moment seeing destruction to our planet made me feel like I had a chance to step in and do something for a change.\\n\\nI am working on a project that will utilize technology as a means to reward and incentivize people for participating in global recycling initiatives by building a community where they can do this.\\n\\nAs a non profit, my goal isn't necessarily to sell products and make profit or sell a service, but rather provide a service free to use that will allow people to use these devices publicly to aid in cleanup efforts. Whether it in public or at home. The idea is to be able to channel clean, recyclable waste back to factories before they hit waste management facilities and dumps.\\n\\nThere are a few major points.\\n\\n1. People\\n2. Device / App / Development\\n3. Affiliates / Sponsorships\\n\\nThere are plenty of people who currently recycle, so promoting and advertisement doesn't worry me. As far as the device, unfortunately I don't have the funds to manufacture and develop 10, 100 or even 1000's if possible. I veered aware from mass production and turned to strategic placement to cut down on costs, maintenance, malfunctions etc.\\n\\nRecently I've just acquired my EIN after obtaining my legal documents for articles of incorporation as a  non profit. Aiming to be 501c3 tax exempt. Unfortunately that's where my progress halts.\\n\\nI'm still working on a logo to file copyright so I can file for my DBA to start advertising. As far as app development and the device. I have a good friend I'd love to partner with who can take care of most of the development and IT.\\n\\nSo once that's done I have some questions ...\\n\\n1. What kind of funding should I aim for ? Angel investing, grants, shares ?\\n2. How can I get companies to jump on board for affiliate marketing ? Reach out directly ?\\n3. I'm not a greedy person by any means. Would it be smart to go 50/50 or 51/49 and have my friend sign an NDA for development since I've already decided I want him working with me ? We're long time friends and have never even officially met. I trust him and think he's perfect for the job. In the end all I want is rights to the business name as CEO.\\n4. What can I expect as a company who isn't flipping products for profit, but rather building a community and using ad sponsorship and affiliate marketing ? Employment numbers would be low due to the structure of the company. But highly beneficial to the economy and environment.\",\n",

       "  'Ok here’s the deal. I started a digital agency 6 years ago with a chap I worked with at an IT company. 7 months ago, I sold my shares to him because I felt we weren’t delivering the quality of work / working with clients that I aligned with - I didn’t get a restraint of trade because digital is my craft. We had a team of 7 and built it to the point where we had solid cash flow and a core group of clients, but it just wasn’t my jam.\\n\\nI’m passionate about digital commerce + cutting edge stuff, he liked small businesses - so there was a huge disconnect in where we were passionate / where we could build value.\\n\\nOver the past 6 months I have built another agency that focuses on 80% digital commerce - its going swimmingly to be honest. Turnover of 35k a month on average with this looking to increase from here. The profits margins are insanely high because a lot of the work is done by me. I specialise in the digital side of things - PPC, SEO and high level strategy - mainly digital performance based stuff.\\n\\nI am technical enough to manage dev ops and can use XD to the point where I can mock up wireframes and hand then over to UI guys to make them look pretty.\\n\\nI have a team of devs I use (that i have used for 3-4 years) and they are “ok”, a lot of managing and a lot of bug testing - the end product always turns out good though because they do what you ask, but just dont have the X factor when it comes to development (most outsourced dev outfits are like this IMO).\\n\\nI have a few contract UI guys and although the work they do is good, its still missing that 20% that takes an ok design to an amazing design. This is generally due to the disconnect between the designers and devs. Some of the best projects I have worked on is when they communicate directly and can have open and honest convos about what animation, where, how it should behave in screen X vs screen  Y - all of those final touches that make a web presence amazing.\\n\\nMy plan is to run my current setup like it is now to the end of the year and make a decent buck at the end of the year.

These higher end clients always appeal to me because:\\n\\nA) Larger paid budgets so the retainers are generally a lot juicer + it allows search guys to actually drill down and fine tune their craft - not work on 100+ smaller accounts that are, well, shit and boring.\\n\\nB) More technical requirements for web - more complex website = more hours = bigger projects. Once again, more room for devs and designers to properly get their teeth sunk in to projects to produce industry leading platforms. Not a lot you really do for a client that has a 5k budget apart from banging up something that “works”, but is by no means “wow”\\n\\nC) Way more recognition and the potential to start hitting exponential growth once you have landed a few whales are huge (there is an agency where I live that have done just this and now look after some MASSIVE brands world wide)\\n\\nTo do the above, I really need people who are some of the best / motivated in their field. I have worked with lots of devs who are ‘ok’, lots of designers who are ‘ok’, but the majority of contractors that you pay $30-$40 an hour to are there for the pay check and I have found aren’t able to properly take full responsibility for an outcome (I realise this could just be a bias).\\n\\nNow, this isn’t a “a want the whales to come to me” post.

But, before I do that, I want the right people on board.\\n\\nAfter many hours thinking, weighing up options and and generally banging my head trying to get out of this paradox, I have finally realised that the only option to create beautiful things, is to dilute my share holding and find people who have the potential to be the best in their field - and give them a piece of the pie.\\n\\nFor instance, development is a whole other world and so much time is burned going back and forth between my dev team.... \\n\\nSo I need a CTO / Technical lead that can:\\n\\nA) Do the dev work at the start\\nB) Come up with a workflow and choose scaleable frameworks that fit with what we want to do\\nC) Help find other devs, induct them in to the fold of the way OUR dev ops works.\\n\\nI will also need a creative director that can:\\n\\nA) Do the UX/UI work at the start\\nB) Come up with a design framework\\nC) Find other designers who fit well with the way we flow.\\n\\n\\nI’m writing this because I literally do not know where to start with finding these guys. I believe it’ll take some time to find those that have the technical acumen but are also willing to grow this to something amazing AND can communicate within a team (once again, yet to find a dev that can communicate properly - once again, could be a bias and I could just be working with the wrong types of devs).\\n\\nReddit, any thoughts on how I can do this....',\n",

       "  'Hi All,\\n\\nI\\'ve been researching for several days now without reaching out to a lawyer or CPA and wanted to see what setup makes the most sense from a taxation standpoint. Here\\'s the background:\\n\\n* I\\'m \"semi-retired\" (i.e. No FT or PT job as of earlier this year, 3 months of W2 income for IRS Tax Year 2020 from two firms; No 1099s from contracting work).\\n* Friend of mine and I won a 6-month, $750K IT contract as our first consulting gig. Over 90% of the contract value is our labor/development (high-margin). The rest is CapEx.\\n* He and another friend have agreed that I would form an LLC with myself having 100% ownership and they would be compensated for work at an hourly rate paid as subcontractors (1099s) for the duration of this contract. (Reason: They both have FT jobs pulling W2s with full benefits from well known technology companies in the U.S.)\\n* I\\'ve formed the LLC earlier this month in the State of Washington, applied and have gotten my EIN for the entity from the IRS and opened business checking & savings account with a major bank along with a revolving line-of-credit tied to the EIN, backed up personally to me.\\n\\n**Question: How best to structure the LLC from a taxation standpoint, both business & personally?**\\n\\nAfter researching a little, it seems electing to become an S-Corp is best, but I\\'m not quite sure. Here\\'s a bit more information:\\n\\n* I would like to only pull what my living expenses are from the profits of the LLC maximizing and avoiding double-taxation. Though I\\'ve read how I elect how the LLC is treated, I may be forced to pay \"comparable & market\" rates to myself for the work I\\'ll be doing which is WAY over my living expenses. **EDIT #3:** My living expenses are about $5,000 a month as a \"semi-retired\" married person with a 20 month-old kid. 👶\\n* I\\'d like to pull large amounts from the LLC profits, personally to me, from time-to-time for large purchases (i.e. properties, personal CapEx, etc.) in the most clean way possible so I\\'m squeaky clean.\\n* I\\'d like to do profit-sharing at the end of my fiscal year (since I formed in September 2020, I\\'m thinking it\\'s best just to make my fiscal year start in September 2020 vs. as nice as it would be to have it be calendar year) but I\\'m not sure since my friends are 1099s and not employees... What are the tax implications there from the LLC standpoint in distributions.\\n\\nThat\\'s about all the details I can think of at the moment. I\\'m sure I\\'m leaving certain information out and if I am, please yell at me. Thanks in advance for any comments, advice and flames!\\n\\n**EDIT #1:** I just remembered one important note. —The primary reason for the formation of the LLC was to protect the IP from the work we\\'re doing for the client. The LLC will own 100% of the IP for the work done from the client due to the fact that this IP might be reusable in the future to launch a product/service which will serve similar firms, but non directly competing firms of said client in their dominant geographical market, if it seems if a great viable market for the product/service we\\'re creating exists. (i.e. #SolvingACommonProblem).\\n\\n**EDIT #2:** The amount (%) of profit-sharing/bonus structure hasn\\'t been determined yet. I don\\'t need the LLC to generate lots of profit in and for itself above OpEx and a small cash-reserve to help with future discovery projects and small CapEx. This first go around, I would like most of the LLC profits to go to the people who successfully helps execute this client project. LLC has about a 15-20% gross shave off the above mentioned project revenue. The only OpEx is like JIRA/Asana, Slack, GSuite, HarvestApp, Quickbooks, GitHub/GitLab, Giphy, Adobe Creative Suite...

       "  'It\\'s no secret that many startups, perhaps especially in tech, struggle with diversity. You start with your own network, and then you hire people who have the skills you need and fit your culture. Before you know it, you have a team that looks and thinks a lot like you. \\n\\nYou worry about how that comes across to employees, future candidates, and investors, and you want to make your team more diverse, but when you post jobs, you get even more applicants who don\\'t really add to the diversity of you team.\\n\\nA few tips that might help you find, attract, and keep more diverse candidates:\\n\\n1) If your applicant pool isn\\'t diverse enough, don\\'t think you\\'re stuck. It may be time to slow down and rethink your hiring strategy. What are you doing to build the right pipeline?\\n\\n2) Build relationships with the tech community. In DC, we have Women Who Code, Black Code Collective, and other groups that are helping to make the tech scene here more diverse. I don\\'t see enough small businesses and new startups getting involved with these groups, even though they\\'re often looking for things like spaces to host Meetups.\\n\\n3) Listen to your current employees. To quote [Hillary Turnipseed, a local tech exec](https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/insight/how-to-cultivate-a-recruiting-process-and-workplace-where-diversity-thrives/), to \"create an inclusive workforce...it’s necessary to establish an environment and culture where employees are heard and valued. You want to set up a place where feedback from employees can be proactively brought to the leadership team.\" By listening to all your employees about their issues and needs, you\\'ll also be giving your most marginalized employees a space to speak up and be heard.\\n\\n4) Involve your employees in the hiring process. Make them a part of your story, brand, and marketing. Put them on interview panels. A diverse interview panel will help attract more diverse talent.\\n\\n5) Don\\'t accidentally focus on just one level or position within your company. For example, hiring more diverse talent should not mean only hiring more diverse talent for entry level roles.\\n\\n6) Forgive honest mistakes. To borrow from the article I mentioned earlier, \"A huge aspect of creating a good environment for diverse employees is to be aware of the pressures that minorities often feel. For me as a black woman, I sometimes put the weight of the world on my shoulders, just sort of by default. I don’t ask for help because I might be viewed as incapable.\"\\n\\nYou might notice that these tips have a common theme: you don\\'t have to single anyone out or give anyone special treatment to make your company more diverse. Good practices like listening to your employees\\' feedback can go a long way.\\n\\nAny other tips I could add to this list?',\n",

Is there a roadmap?\\n\\n* Do you have an exit strategy?\\n\\n* Are you open to acquisition?\\n\\n* What are you asking investors for (money, connections, mentorship) and how will it be used?\\n\\n* How well does this scale up if it's successful? How will you scale it?\\n\\n* If given the resources requested, can your team commit? How long will it take to execute?\\n\\n* Average cost of customer acquisition and lifetime value of the average customer?\\n\\nThey don't all have to be fleshed out but I think anyone pitching should at least have a confident answer to all of the above questions in mind and all of them should be at least touched on in the pitch. Any to add?\",\n",
       "  \"Hi everyone! I recently started an e-distribution business in March this year with a friend who has multiple businesses in a (mildly) related industry. Capital is not really a problem. We have multiple clients already and are in the process of signing more. Business has been really good and exciting. Our share of financial investment is like 80-20, I gave 20 + the expertise. Our organization is functioning as a startup, very lean but as clients increase we are adding more people to maintain quality. \\n\\nThis started out as a side hustle for the first 5 months, then clients started coming in and approaching us. As I am the expert in the industry and we needed someone to focus on the business (cause he's running other businesses), we decided that I will work on the business full time.\\n\\nMy partner and I agreed that I will take a salary, let's say it is x amount. This is okay for me and will allow me to support my family and myself and also save up. We also agreed that in the first 4 months of me full time on the business, my salary will only be 75% of x amount. On the 5th month and so on, it will be x amount. \\n\\nSales is all good and well but I know that we havent breakeven yet. Because of this, I've been feeling guilty taking a salary and increasing the salary on my 4th month but I really need it because a family member is sick and Im supporting my brother's tuition payments. My partner is not worried as he told me this is how it really is in the beginning. This is my first. \\n\\nHow do you deal with this mentality and what do you suggest I do moving forward?\\n\\nEdit: thank you so much for all your answers! They've been very enlightening. My partner doesnt mind at all about my salary. It's just me in my head. :( Thanks everyone!\",\n",

       "  'Pitching is such a critical part of any startup and yet so many entrepreneurs have never been taught how to pitch effectively. I want to change that by showing you not only how to pitch, but how to pitch so effectively that you will win competitions and investors doing so. \\n\\nMy pitch framework consists of the 5 sections of a pitch: Writing the pitch, Delivery, Pitch Deck Slides, Stage Presence, and Q & A.\\n\\nSection 1: Writing the Pitch\\n\\nStep 1 is your introduction or your “why” and you have 2 key goals.\\n\\n1) Be engaging. People have limited attention spans.You need to be engaging if you want people to pay attention to your pitch. 2) Introduce the problem. You are pitching a problem where you have a solution.Always start your pitch discussing why your audience should care. Why does the problem matter?\\n\\nWhen you are writing your own introduction, I recommend utilizing some of the powerful oratory tools that I used: \\n\\nPersonal anecdotes - “students telling me they’ve skipped whole meals” \\n\\nEmotive language -  “That’s lost money for businesses, empty stomachs for students”\\n\\nStep 2 of your pitch is “the who and the how”: 1) Introduce yourself and your team if you have one. This personal touch puts a name to a face and humanizes you more, which helps with engagement. Investors and judges care about who is helping you solve this problem so even a quick introduction will have a positive impact. 2) Introduce your solution briefly and focus on how it works. If you have a tagline this is the time to use it and Make sure you give a clear explanation of how you solve the problem\\n\\nStep 3 of your pitch is “the what”: What you do specifically to solve the problem? Is your solution a product, a service, or an app? This is where you want to highlight any successes you’ve already encountered in the form of users or customers\\n\\nStep 4 of your pitch is about finances: 1) Introduce the market size for your business. How big is the industry you will be disrupting or helping with your solution? How many customers will your solution be relevant to? 2) Show your progress selling your solution. If you have any paid contracts, paid user, or other paying customers this is where you want to highlight your progress. \\n\\nStep 5 of your pitch focuses on customer satisfaction: 1) What value have you been providing your customers. Give a quick rundown of the benefits your customer receive by paying for your solution 2) Customer acquisition. Has your customers experience led to any further sales or expansion within their network?\\n\\nThe 6th and final step of writing your pitch is your conclusion: 1) Focus on your future plans. You’ve already told the judges or investors what you are doing now, so you want to provide your long term vision for your company.  What will your impact be in the next 10 years? 2) A call to action. If you are pitching to investors your call to action is for them to invest. If you are pitching to judges, your call to action is for them to declare you the winner.\\n\\nSection 2: Delivery\\n\\nThere are 3 C’s to remember:\\n\\nYour delivery should be Clear.\\n\\nYour delivery should exude Confidence.\\n\\nYour delivery should be Concise.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSection 3: Pitch Deck Slides\\n\\nEach slide should follow all of these 3 rules: \\n\\n1) A single idea per slide. \\n\\n2) The slide should complement what you are saying. \\n\\n3) The slide should be as minimalistic as possible, uncluttered, with no unnecessary text.\\n\\nEvery slide in your pitch deck should conform to these 3 rules.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSection 4: Stage Presence\\n\\nThere are 4 main Stage presence considerations to consider:\\n\\n1) If you are pitching solo always wear a suit or equivalent female professional wear.\\n\\n2) If you have a team make sure you all look the same.\\n\\n3) If your solution can have a prop make sure to incorporate it into your pitch.\\n\\n4) Make sure you and your team are positioned uniformly on stage.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSection 5: Q & A\\n\\nThere are 2 main rules to Q & A\\n\\n1) Practice doing Q & A. Everyone prepares to give a pitch so to stand out you need to prepare just as much for the Q & A. Very rarely will you get a question that could not have been anticipated in one form or another. Even if you do you will be better able to answer it if you have practiced.\\n\\n2) Listen to the questions and answer them completely. You want the judges or investors to feel heard so make sure you are paying attention. Nothing annoys a judge or investor more than feeling like you are dodging or failing to answer the question, so be frank and direct.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you want visual examples of what I have discussed above here is an example of the pitch I gave and won $20K+ with at the 2020 Georgia Tech Inventure Prize: [https://youtu.be/Lwg4yPgHo6s](https://youtu.be/Lwg4yPgHo6s)\\n\\nI hope this helps in your journey of becoming successful entrepreneurs.',\n",

Not only did I build the product, but my contributions led to us pivoting significantly.

Most of the questions that we get from users or potential investors, whether they are related to tech, or our company\\'s vision, are answered by me.\\n\\nJoe does handle day to day operations, and he talks to the rest of the team and gets stuff done, because I\\'m generally busy handling the tech.\\n\\nHowever, instructions for most of what needs to happen comes from me.

I am doing this with a colleague who initially we settled on splitting 50/50. This seems to be the easiest structure (in theory) and we figured that we would divide the work down the middle. (ie getting clients, getting them started, billing hours.).\\n\\nWe were not going to quit our other jobs until we had enough clients on each of our caseloads. (\\\\~12 each). This would allow for the littlest drop in income when transitioning to our company. \\n\\nWe agreed that we would each take 3 clients, run the company for a few months to get our feet wet, and then take on additional clients when certain metrics were met. (utilization of authorized hours & revenue)\\n\\nIt turns out, that my colleague is not going to be able to take more than 1 or two clients to start. I would imagine this changes the way equity is going to be distributed if I am going to be the one bringing in most of the billable hours. Granted, there are other areas that are not billable that I believe he will excel in, but it's hard to determine that before the company is up and running. For instance, he has access to high-quality therapists through teaching at a university, a better-established network of clinicians who could potentially work for us, and a higher degree. (he is a PhD vs me only having a MA).

       "  ' Hey everyone! So I have been working for a startup for around a year now. I was brought on a few months after they initially raised. I was brought on to help with marketing and specifically social media as an independent contractor.\\n\\nThroughout the months I helped organically build an audience for their marketplace, and we experienced a good amount of success. I have worked remotely the entire time, and was in school also. I put in a lot of effort, and helped actually build something which was cool, and inspiring. \\n\\nBut over the recent few months my work has become less and less involved. When I first joined the startup I played a bigger role with planning, ideas etc. During this time I started building up other streams of income, (I had a lot of free time with covid, which helped). Also more recently, another person was brought on who kinda took the position/responsibilities I would have grown into. Now currently, this startup brings in 10% of my income, but like 20-25% of my time. And I’m still just an independent contractor.\\n\\nBasically I am spending a lot of time at this startup every single day, I’m not staying because of the money, and I don’t see myself in a position to grow further in this company. How do I respectfully leave? I’ve never really quit a job before, I want to have references for this experience also though if possible, I don’t want to leave anyone in a bad position. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks',\n",

Since I was never particularly diligent about this investment in the first place, i need some advice!\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nI was investor #1 for a small startup about 3 years ago, with a SAFE at valuation cap of $1M and an 80% discount rate. The company is now being acquired, so the liquidity event is at hand.\\n\\nI invested partially because I wanted to make money and was confident in the founder, but I also had non-monetary incentive.

I know no one can tell me which choice is better except myself, so i am looking for help in how to evaluate this decision. \\n\\nTBH, i am pretty uninformed about all this stuff. I know i can read about it, and it is my personal responsibility to do so, but it still gets me confused. For example, [this quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-discount-and-cap-work-on-a-SAFE-note) is helpful. \\n\\n**Context**\\n\\nI am tempted to roll over my assets into the new company, because they are about to raise a series B. As i understand, if i take my cash now, I get a 3.5x gross return (guaranteed). But given the discount rate, and the huge funding round the acquiring company seeks to execute, I might be able to see a 20x - 40x return (i think), given risk. \\n\\n**Deadlines**\\n\\nI am meeting with the acquiring company's CFO next week, and want to prepare for it, so it's not a huge waste of time for both of us. \\n\\n**Addnl**\\n\\nPlease ask me to provide more information if it is needed.\",\n",

How do you deal with\\nmaintaining your sanity and growing your business while chaos rages all\\naround you?\\n\\nI put links at the bottom of this post to the original blog and video,\\nif you would like to watch rather than read.\\n\\nBlog\\n----\\n\\nI recorded the video for this episode in a hotel room while evacuated\\nfrom my home because of the Kincade fire in Northern California. A few\\ndays earlier, when we were experiencing safety power outages and\\nwatching the extreme fire conditions, I wondered if I should just skip\\nthis episode. I was feeling very stressed and distracted. I thought it\\nmight be interesting to do a short episode about how sometimes life\\nmakes you look at where your true priorities lie. Then on Wednesday,\\nOctober 23, we saw the fire start on a ridge about 15 miles to our north\\nduring another wind event. Between then and when we evacuated on\\nSaturday, I was not focused on anything but the fire.\\n\\nHowever, once we were out of the area, and in a hotel with lots of time\\non our hands, I had time to think more about this issue. I realized that\\nI really wanted to stay on track with these episodes, and that there was\\nnot really any overpowering reason not to. Major adversity can certainly\\njustify all kinds of changes in priorities and plans; it is also easy to\\nuse situations as an excuse. I could easily have just spent my time\\nhanging out in the hotel, refreshing the emergency information web\\npages, and drinking.\\n\\nInstead, I decided to go to a nearby store and pick up a cheap stand for\\nmy phone, so I could record a quick and dirty episode. And doing it made\\nme feel better. I was doing something positive and productive when there\\nwas nothing at all I could do about the main crisis going on.\\n\\nIf you are running a startup, you will likely encounter many existential\\ncrises along the way. Hopefully, most existential to the business, not\\nto you or your family personally. This situation has reminded me of all\\nthe times I experienced that as a founder. At the time, I was actively\\nstudying kung-fu, and one of the lessons from that served me incredibly\\nwell in business, and with this fire. They taught the concept \"mind like\\nwater.\" The idea is that, while water is incompressible, it freely\\nconforms to the shape of the container it is in. A mind like water stays\\nrelaxed and adapts to situations as they happen. Stress and tension sap\\nyou of energy without providing any benefit. They can actually slow down\\nyour reactions and thinking. By staying relaxed, even in the face of\\nadversity, you can quickly pivot to take action on the most appropriate\\ntask at any moment. Whether that be packing all your most valuable\\npossession in a car, or recording a podcast during downtime in a hotel.\\n\\nAs I get ready to post this, our neighborhood is still under mandatory\\nevacuation, but residents are being allowed back.

Our product is an access control system. It's focused primarily on multi-family residential, which are plentiful in Eastern Europe - that's where we're from and where we will start sales from. Secondary focus is B2B - the system is versatile enough to serve corporate users too, but competition is a lot more severe, which is why this market is not the primary one.\\n\\nCore value is supposed to be delivered via software - mobile applications instead of keys/keycards, management of the system via a web application without any locally installed old-school servers, etc.\\n\\nThe problem is this: Even in the best-case scenario, we will be able to start offering the product in 6 months from now - currently we're in the product testing and refinement stage. And investments in marketing aren't expected until that, meaning that for now, I have essentially no budget to work with - nothing but my own paid business hours.\\n\\nI've made a website, created content for it, outlined the general marketing strategy, conducted all sorts of analyses, determined the marketing channels, audience, market needs, etc  - essentially, I know what to do when I have a product ready. But it's not. \\n\\nI've made everything I believe is reasonable at this moment - I simply cannot see what else would be useful to do in the marketing area right until we're ready to sell and we have a marketing budget to start doing that. And that's why I'm inclined to switch to helping the product development directly - testing, docs writing, etc (I 'm capable of doing that at a decently high level and the need is there  - the team is small and overloaded).\\n\\nThe question is: Should I switch to helping refine the product, or it's better to apply extra efforts to the marketing to sort of be more prepared when the time comes?

The problem is that we're dealing with something that requires a lot of capital to even deliver a minimum viable product, so we need to find investors. Nonetheless, there's a ton of work that can be done before funding is even there. As such, two of us have decided not to seek for a full-time job (we just graduated) and put 100% in making this work. The third partner, however, has been working for a few years now, and he has made clear that he won't quit his job. That is the case for both pre-funding and post-funding, as we don't see the need for three people running the business in its initial form. This has led to a discussion (initiated by the two of us committing 100% now and later) as to how much the third party is really worth. He agrees that it's only fair that he receives less shares of the company when it is founded. Our problem right now is: How many shares does this person really earn?\\n\\nSome extra considerations:\\n- The third person has definitely added value in the initial phase of developing the idea;\\n- A lot of work has been put in the pitch, for which the third person only provided comments;\\n- We have met for 2 hours a week (at best) to discuss the progress made on the pitch mostly;\\n- The two of us will be working full-time on the project until we receive funding (or until our personal deadline passes, as we can't be in this phase forever).\\n\\nWe're a bit in a pickle here, because we're friends, and we do see it as our creation. Nonetheless, we have trouble with having a future shareholder that does nothing and isn't even willing to fund the company according to whatever shares he has (albeit with a discount, so to speak). The advantage is that nothing has been agreed on contractually, so at the end of the day the two of us can do whatever we want. However, we want to do the right thing.\\n\\nYou might think that we have nothing to show for yet (i.e. no product), so that this is not a conversation worth having.

We sell a product that fairly bulky, no moving parts, but does have stitching around the edges.  I think we have a good manufacturer (China) and we have a good relationship (I think).  As we've begun to grow our sales, I'm getting a few emails back from customers letting me know that the stitching on this item is coming out and the side is tearing a bit.

I really don't know - should I be shooting for 100% good?  \\n\\n\\n3) Moving forward - as I get larger and order more product - what sort of agreements should I have in place with my manufacturer as far as quality control?

       "  'Startup-life can be really, really crazy at times. The story below happened to me recently. What\\'s your thoughts on this, what would you do?\\n\\nIt\\'s a long read, but here is a TLDR;\\n\\n*TLDR; Joined startup as co-founder, worked 6 months for equity only, fired for no cause, threatened with promises of violence if I didn\\'t sign termination contract. Also had my reputation damaged when the CEO sent emails to my network stating I was a scammer and thief, in order to pressure me to sign the contract.*\\n\\n**February**\\n\\nI was contacted by the CEO of a software startup, and asked to join the company as a Project/Product\\xa0Manager and co-founder. The company was at this time without technical employees, and the development process had been at a standstill for several months since a contract with an agency had expired. My task was to restart the development process by hiring new developers and managing the development team. I joined because the product was really nice. A beautiful app I definitely would use myself. I also liked the drive of the founder. He had a strong CV as well.\\n\\nI joined the startup on an \"Independent Contractors Agreement\", where I was told this was to test how our collaboration would work out. If I would be fired or quit in this period, I would have a right to compensation according to the hourly fee stated in the contract and the hours worked.\\n\\n**April**\\n\\nI join the startup officially as a co-founder with 12.5% equity and sign the Founders Agreement. Another co-founder also joined at this time. 1 year cliff, 48 months vesting.\\n\\n**June**\\n\\nThe 3rd co-founder is fired since he didn\\'t have time to work without pay, and I am sent a contract where I agree to that the 3rd co-founder leaves the company. There is also a point in this contract where I agree to let go of any financial claims related to the \"Independent Contractors Agreement\". In retrospect, it seems very strange that this point was added in connection with the firing of the 3rd co-founder. But I was cool with it at that point because we had an oral agreement from when I joined in February, where we agreed to forget about the independent contractors agreement and rather shorten my vesting schedule with a few months. So, the vesting was also changed at this point, reduced by 3 months.\\n\\n**A week later**\\n\\nAfter 60+ rigourous interviews, I hire 2 developers I am thrilled to work with. I know the CEO would never be able to find these people himself, he doesn\\'t have both the technical nor the social skills to do that. Recruiting is hard in the first place, and it is even harder to recruit senior developers for equity only during Covid-19. So this was a major achievement, in my opinion. Turns out this achievement was the beginning of the end for me.\\n\\nWe have planned to start a 2-week sprint starting in the afternoon. Beforehand, I have been asked by the CEO to list the planned tickets in a form with time estimates from the developers. I told him several times this didn\\'t make much sense, but that I would do it. I asked the developers to give me an estimate and have it ready by the start of the workday (they live in 2 different continents, so they start working in the afternoon local time). The reason I think it didn\\'t make much sense is that the developers couldn\\'t possibly give time estimates this early. They just joined and are not familiar with the codebase. We need to have a thorough discussion about the tickets before we start the sprint. In any case, this shouldn\\'t be the CEOs business, I am the one managing the developers. But he is extremely micromanaging and distrusting in general, so this was common behaviour.\\n\\nAround 14:00 the CEO asks me why the form with the time estimates is not yet updated, and I reply that the developers have not responded to me yet, but that he is not to worry, as the workday hasn\\'t started yet, and we in any case will have to discuss the tickets with the developers when the meeting starts at 16:00. The CEO does not agree with me, and fires me on the spot, by saying \"This is not working out, I will find another project manager\"\\xa0\\n\\nI immediately understand I will be leaving this company no matter what, as we can\\'t continue from here. He is obviously a complete douchebag, and is basically firing me without good cause. I am supposed to get a 30-day warning in these cases according to our contract. So I respond quickly, and tell him I am leaving, while also mentioning how I think his leadership style is severely lacking, and other things I feel is dysfunctional in the company. I am polite though, and end it with saying I am sorry it had to end this way. The only response I get back is \"thanks\".\\n\\nFollowing this, all the other employees in the company (3 of them who I recently recruited, in addition to the CTO), contacts me and say they are very surprised about the news, and share their sympathies with me.\\n\\nMy access to all accounts (Slack, email, Jira, etc) is revoked within 30-60 minutes after my chat with the CEO. Slack was also where we had our last chat, so I didn\\'t even have time to save our chatlog. If I hadn\\'t been working remotely, I am sure I would have been escorted out by security guards. I felt very disrespected. It also felt like this was planned ahead. I did my job, solved a problem, worked for free for 6 months, and got kicked out right after I recruited a backend dev who got the same amount of equity as me. So in essence the guy I recruited will get my equity.\\n\\n**Mid July**\\n\\nI am sent an termination contract, where it is claimed that I am terminated due to bad performance, and that I am therefore a \"Bad leaver\", meaning I have no rights to equity or compensation. I did not sign the contract, as I knew this was a lie.\\n\\nI respond to the sent contract, that I am going to have a lawyer look at at it and that it may take some time. I was strongly considering taking legal action, but was on the fence due to not knowing how good a case I had. Also was exhausted after spending 6 months of my time on this for nothing, and wanted to enjoy my summer holiday. So I let him wait, as I think it\\'s my right to get some time to think about this.\\n\\n**August**\\n\\nThe CEO contacts me a few times and asks about the status on the contract, I give the same reply, that he will have to wait.\\n\\nWe agree on him coming by my apartment to pick up a phone the company bought me. He never shows up, despite having made 2 appointments with him. I think he doesn\\'t have the guts to face me.\\n\\n**Late August**\\n\\nI am contacted again and asked about the contract. This time I told him I can\\'t sign the contract as it stands. I gave him the option to send me another contract where it says I quit. I decided it was not worth more trouble, I am just going to close this chapter and move on with my life. A lawsuit would be time consuming and expensive. By this time I am also well involved with another startup, both receiving equity and salary, so I don\\'t want more distractions.\\n\\n**KABOOM!**\\n\\n**The CEO explodes in a raging fit and sends me threatening audio messages. I am told he and several others with \"Russian connections\" will come to my apartment to pick me up if I don\\'t sign the contract, and \"anything can happen, who knows\". He even claims the angel investor is the one with Russian ties, and is the one I should fear. I can hardly believe my ears, this guy is batshit crazy.\\xa0My wife got very upset by this, the rest of my family as well. (Note: I am in a Western European country)**\\n\\nHe also threatened to send emails to people in my professional network. Which he ended up doing shortly after:\\n\\n**Later that day, I am contacted by people in my network, saying they have received messages from the CEO stating that I am not responding to emails and that they are looking for me - and that I have an iPhone that belongs to the company. I am, effectively, labeled as a thief and scammer.**\\n\\nI seize communication with the CEO at this point, as it is getting way too weird for me. He\\'s clearly out of control. He later sends me screenshots of some conversations with people in my professional network, where he is telling them I have this phone and is not responding.\\n\\nI am then contacted by the (interim) CTO/tech advisor in the company who apologizes profusely for this behaviour, and asks how we can proceed from here to solve the problem. He offers to mediate. I accept and tell him I want an apology and retractment sent to everyone who has received messages about me, as well as documentation of this. I also again request a contract that states I quit of my own free will. Even though I am clearly quitting due to force and threats, I don\\'t want to have anything to do with the company, it is mentally exhausting. I have to say though, the CTO is a nice guy, I have nothing against anyone in the company except the CEO.\\n\\n**Last update:**\\n\\n**September:**\\n\\n**I still haven\\'t received any documentation of the requested apologies and retractions sent to my professional network.

       "  'Author and former director of the World Bank, Steve Denning, interviewed 2017’s world’s #1 management thinker, Roger Martin, about his new book: When More is Not Better.\\n\\nLINK: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2020/08/18/overcoming-americas-obsession-with-economic-efficiency/#6cf4c80d2f2b\\n\\nIt’s a fascinating article, with two longtime mainstream management thinkers going back and forth about how the discipline has evolved from “maximizing shareholder value” (what Martin calls “the dumbest idea in the world” in his 2012 book: Fixing the Game) to managing holons of complex adaptive systems inside of complex adaptive systems.\\n\\nIn its simplest form, the craft of management is now being recognized by its leaders as having moved from football to basketball. From complicated to complex.\\n\\nFrom Brave New Work, by Aaron Dignan:\\n\\n“Contrary to popular opinion, among people who study systems theory, “complicated” and “complex” are distinct words with precise meanings. The engine inside a car is complicated. A complicated system is a causal system—meaning it is subject to cause and effect. Although it may have many parts, they will interact with one another in highly predictable ways. Problems with complicated systems have solutions. This means that, within reason, a complicated system can be fixed with a high degree of confidence. It can be controlled.\\n\\nThis is not to say that a complicated system can’t be confusing or inaccessible to the layperson. Quite the contrary. Understanding a complicated system, such as an engine or a 3-D printer, requires specialized expertise and experience. Here, experts can detect patterns and provide solutions based on established good practice. This is the domain of the mechanic, the watchmaker, the air traffic controller, the architect, and the engineer.\\n\\nTraffic, on the other hand, is complex. A complex system is not causal, it’s dispositional. We can make informed guesses about what it is likely to do (its disposition), but we can’t be sure. We can make predictions about the weather, but we cannot control it. Unlike complicated problems, complex problems cannot be solved, only managed. They cannot be controlled, only nudged. This is the domain of the butterfly effect, where a small change can lead to something big, and a big change might barely make a dent. Here expertise can be a disadvantage if it becomes dogma or blinds us to the inherent uncertainty present in our situation.”\\n\\nAbout time.\\n\\nBusiness has never been complicated, despite decades of management theory trying to make it so. This book is important because once HBR talks about it, Fortune 500 businesses listen. The mainstream is recognizing what the edge has used as their competitive advantage for years: that business is complex, and the best way to manage that is highly engaged, empowered, and aligned people.',\n",

Usually, I fill in a template and copy-paste the summary info from the blog article into the email, and schedule it for the upcoming Monday.

       "  'I currently lead operations (customer success, support and renewals) for a small enterprise software company. My current employer has 25 FTEs and generates $7 million in annual revenue. I report directly to the CEO, who is the sole decision-maker as this is a bootstrapped company. \\n\\nMy current boss is a micromanager and has made some ethically questionable decisions, so when a larger competitor reached out, I was curious what they had to offer. For context, the competitor is VC funded and has approximately 150 employees and $25 million in ARR. I quickly learned that I am underpaid and overworked for this niche market, as the employee to revenue ratio indicates. \\n\\nNext week I’ll be receiving an offer from the competitor. This will only be for an individual contributor role (think: technical solution manager) but offers a higher base salary and better benefits. The challenge is I believe the competitor is likely to lowball me (relative the position’s range), despite moving quickly on my candidacy and having very positive feedback throughout. \\n\\nDuring this process, I’ve been discussing two different roles at the same level with one offering higher total compensation due to commissions. They’re now trying to say that they want all new hires to start in the lower paid role. I’m not thrilled about this, and the recruiter threw out some salary numbers at the lower end of the range ($125-135k). As I have experience in this specific niche and would be taking a cut in seniority to work for them, I believe I should be an exception to start in the higher paid role and receive the higher end of the salary range ($150k+). \\n\\nI am very likely to receive a counteroffer from my current boss, as my role is business critical and we’re understaffed as it is. In terms of the comparison between the competitor and my current employer:\\n\\n*Overall compensation: Likely competitor as my current compensation is ~ 25% bonus, which is variable from quarter to quarter and heavily taxed  \\n*Benefits: Competitor \\n*Title: Current Employer\\n*Influence: Current Employer\\n*Market share: Competitor \\n*Leadership: Competitor\\n*Team: Likely current employer because I’m the hiring manager\\n*Equity: Not a significant factor \\n*Location: Not significant \\n*Travel requirements: Similar\\n*Workload: Position with the competitor would be significantly less work\\n*Signing bonus: Unlikely\\n\\nHow should I approach this? My current employer is less than ideal, but I already have a better title and more influence than I would have at the competitor. I would also need both a promotion (think: VP of Operations) and raise to stay but have a good chance of getting both. (I received a promotion and raise early this year, but both were underwhelming.)  \\n\\nI know I need to ask for a few days to think about the offer and then come back with a counter. How should I approach this with my current employer? If the initial offer is decent, I’m thinking I skip straight to submitting my resignation to get a strong counter while I’m still negotiating the competitor’s offer. (My boss tends to only offer significant incentives when forced.) Thoughts? \\n\\nNotes: I’m borderline FIRE (financially independent/retire early) but would like to work another 10+ years in tech before pursuing lower paying work that I enjoy more. While I have options aside from these two employers, finding a comparable position outside of this niche would be more difficult. \\n\\nTL/DR: Receiving an offer from a stronger competitor in the market and will need to negotiate. Also hoping to get a counter from my current employer. Need to get the last, best and final from both quickly in order to make a decision.',\n",

       "  'I wanted to share some realizations I had recently with the hope that it can help somebody else who\\'s just starting a business or to find people who might be sharing the same.\\n\\nI\\'ve been in the startup ecosystem for almost 2 years, in an industry that is currently growing (in other words - it\\'s a hell to sell). For these 2 years, I learned A LOT. Maybe because I didn\\'t have any previous experience and needed to learn everything the hard way, or maybe because I was too naive...\\n\\n### The biggest lie\\nWe all \"know\" that in order to succeed we need to work 14+ hours a day, 7 days a week, for months and months. After all, it\\'s the hard work that makes the difference, right? \"Work now, party later\", \"Work like hell\" - And all the startup gurus are saying the same thing. Even more, our local startup community and friends are doing the same. You see FB & Instagram stories \"Hustle at 2 am\", then another story from the gym at 6 am. It must be the truth, but why we\\'re not feeling happy, or good. After all, we\\'re leaving the dream!\\n\\nThe truth is - it\\'s all a fucking lie. In fact, it\\'s the exact opposite. Let me explain why.\\n\\n### The truth\\nNo one can deny that having a startup can be a fucking hell. Constant depression, stress, and anxiety can drive you crazy (especially if it\\'s your first time). Somedays you just want to hide somewhere and forget about everything. \\n\\nIt\\'s even harder if you do that all alone - no cofounders, no friends (most don\\'t really care about you if they don\\'t need a favor), no girlfriend (or boyfriend), not working out or having time for yourself. It\\'s slowly killing you from inside out. I\\'ve been there.\\n\\nYou might not be realizing it at first, but at a certain point, all of this is starting to reflect on your business as well.\\n\\n### Your social life is as important as your startup\\n\\nYour social life, friendships, nights out, working out, sexual life (having a girlfriend/boyfriend), time for yourself is as important as your startup (if not even more). I can\\'t stress how crucial is that for your well-being.\\n\\nIt\\'s not about working hard, it\\'s about working smart. It\\'s about working 9/5 for yourself! And don\\'t get me wrong there is a huge difference between **working 9/5 for someone else** & **working 9/5 for yourself**. \\n\\nWorking 8h a day, 5 days a week will actually help you stay focused on the work. It will help you find ways to be more productive and work smarter than harder. Having free time (for your social life) will actually help you recharge your batteries. You\\'ll be happier which will reflect tremendously on your startup.\\n\\nThe gold environment is where there is a balance between the two. After all, we are humans - we need to socialize, to feel loved, to take care of our well-being. It\\'s a long game and at a certain point in your business journey, you\\'ll realize it.

       "  'Hi, so I have a dilemma what to do. \\n\\nA week ago I started a 100% remote internship at a startup. It\\'s supposed to last 6 months. It\\'s registered as an LTD in the UK and I\\'m also based in the UK.\\n\\nMy role is a graphic designer. I\\'m still a student and I already had two unpaid internships in startups abroad (with only paid accommodation costs - these weren\\'t remote internships) before this one.\\n\\nNow when I joined the team I learned that most of the employees are unpaid interns too. There are like between 11-20 people in the team. We all work remote across various countries on 4 different continents. I think the only paid people are the experienced devs and the founder and his friend. The whole UI/UX design team are two MA students who are unpaid interns too. The marketing team consists of 3 UK-based students (again unpaid) and one Indian guy who is like the marketing executive/manager, but from his LinkedIn profile and his posts there it seems like he\\'s unpaid too (he referred to it as an internship so that\\'s why I think so).\\n\\nThe branding of this company isn\\'t great. Frankly, it\\'s not really developed yet. Like, their website and logo looks good, but there is no set style for the social media graphics. This week I was expected to produce some graphics for social media which I did, but I heard from one of the other designers that the boss doesn\\'t like some of it, that \"it doesn\\'t fit the brand\". The problem is, there are no other social media posts (they just started) to rely on for the guidelines in terms of style. There is no designer employed to develop the brand visual identity, the UX/UI people focus more on the app itself and the marketing people are just a bunch of unpaid students with no background in branding either. I could develop the brand style myself, I think it\\'d be good for my portfolio. However, it would take time especially with me working here only 10 hours a week and the boss is very pushy with timing and says we need to start posting social media content asap.\\n\\nI also feel like this internship may interrupt my studies. Now I don\\'t have uni yet, but it starts next week. I agreed to do this internship for approx. 10 hours a week. However, I get messages like everyday through the past week, I think I spent like 2-3 hours just on the calls/virtual meetings alone. And then in just 7 hours I\\'m expected to prepare all the other files for all social media channels. It makes me anxious because I feel the time pressure and I don\\'t really want to work more than the agreed 10 hours as it will result in me having less time for my uni and college (I\\'m taking two courses this year). After I raised some concerns regarding lack of branding direction during the all team meeting (I mentioned I\\'ve already worked over 10 hours this week - which is true - I said it bc I felt the need to justify why I didn\\'t manage to do some other stuff (illustrations for the app) they wanted me to do), the boss called me privately and said \"doesn\\'t it says 10 to 20 hours in your contract?\" It\\'s a bit of a red flag for me, felt like he tried to pressure me to put in more work hours during the week, even though the contract states \"approx. 10 hours\" and this guy himself said during the interview that \"it\\'s 10 hours, it\\'s like a one full-time work day a week\".\\n\\nSo my questions are: what do you think about situations like this? Should I leave this start up or do you think this experience is still worth it? Is it exploitive behaviour from the founder\\'s side? Or am I overreacting? I don\\'t mind working or doing some projects for free in order to improve my portfolio, I\\'ve done it in the past. But at the same time I don\\'t like being taken advantage of and that\\'s how I feel right now given that there are no senior graphic designers (or you know just normal paid designers employees) or even marketing & PR people to mentor me properly in my field. In the previous startups I\\'ve been in the ratio of interns to employees was much more healthy like 2-3 interns to approx 12 paid employees.\\n\\nTL;DR: The vast majority of the people in the startup are unpaid interns, including me. I\\'m a graphic design intern, but there is no senior/normal paid graphic designer to provide me with mentoring. The boss tries to push me to work more than agreed 10 hours a week and I\\'m scared it will affect negatively my studies as I take two courses this year.',\n",

       "  \"One of the hardest parts of building an enterprise SaaS company is figuring out how to crack large accounts –\\xa0$100k-$10m annual contracts. I've been thinking and writing on this topic recently, and wanted to share some of those thoughts below ([original post here](https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/09/01/enterprise-selling-dont-say-no.html)):\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nTo sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.\\n\\nEnterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.\\n\\nThe decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “[Selling Sunset](https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/),” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).\\n\\nContrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, [moving to the cloud](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/) – can be [exponentially more complex](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/). The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.\\n\\n## Detractors Want You to Say “No”\\n\\nInnumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.\\n\\nAdversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:\\n\\n* Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.\\n* Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.\\n* Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.\\n* People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.\\n* Competitors.\\n* (Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.\\n\\nOne of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is **time**. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.\\n\\nIn order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data *just right* for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.\\n\\nWays to say Yes more:\\n\\n1. Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.\\n2. Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.\\n3. Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.\\n4. Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.\\n5. Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales & marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.\\n\\nNote that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.\\n\\n## Case Study: Salesforce\\n\\nSalesforce has a *decent* product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.\\n\\nIf you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:\\n\\n* They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.\\n* They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.\\n* They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).\\n* Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.\\n* Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.\\n\\n## Case Study: Slack\\n\\nSlack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:\\n\\n* They have a web of Slash /commands, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.\\n* They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.\\n* They once made it dead simple [to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat](https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack) (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). [They still provide this for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams).\\n* Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.\\n* As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.\\n\\n## Takeaways\\n\\nSaying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:\\n\\n* Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.\\n* Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.\\n* Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.\\n* Build no-regrets enterprise features.\\n* Sell to the right customers.\",\n",

I've had two decent exits  that helped fund some of the current things in my pipeline. \\n\\nThe first product that I'm looking for help with, is a consumer product that ages red wine in under 20 minutes... we had to sideline it due to funding; This product is at the launch line and could goto market immediately, everything is done. Have an entire design package (STEP files, GERBER files, mold drawings for manufacturing, quotes for manufacturing, the works). We got into one of the nations largest accelerators because of this product, but since it's the only product they've ever featured, we got little help unfortunately. \\n\\nDue to my biz partner getting robbed and shot four times in the back using Offerup and those users being anonymous and Offerup hiding behind two huge law firms... we had an idea for an app. We started (and finished) development of an Instagram 'feel' P2P eCommerce rental platform that lets you list or rent just about anything you can think of. Partnered with two delivery companies, locker systems, ID verification companies, insurance providers, the works. Was raising funds in The Bay when COVID shut everything down, so we are sitting on that until things loosen up (it'll be on the app store in stealth mode next week or two).  This app ALSO got into an accelerator (still is). Unfortunately, again, due to COVID, it's on hold. \\n\\nWhile talking to a Partner at a very large and well known VC firm beginning of May, he was discussing a problem he had while on lockdown (a problem not exclusive to lockdown but only exacerbated because of it). He was bitching on the Zoom call about what happened and that if someone could solve the issue, its something A.H. would definitely invest in.\\n\\nSo we put our thinking caps on and solved it. \\n\\nIncorporated end of May, finished our very usable prototype and the backend part that communicates with it (it's an IoT device).  I can't get into this one on here quite yet (we have a non-provisional patent filed already and would discuss it privately), but lets just say it addresses quite a few problems in one solution and the randomized/anonymous surveys that we've had done, all point to a sizable TAM (Single Family Home Owners, $100k a year income, one kid under 18, frequently uses IoT devices, Frequently uses delivery providers). \\n\\nWe got into a third accelerator, this one funded by a very famous Billionaire. We get a TON of support here. They have a TON of resources, but the one thing that isn't growing on trees... are C-level or should I saw, C-capable executives that are hungry, know what they're doing and believe in our products... \\n\\n...which is why I'm here. \\n\\nWe have a seasoned team supporting both products.

On the platform we are creating every user is essentially an active user according to Stripe which goes hand in hand with a 2$ charge per month. We are expecting most transactions being pretty low. So this is an enormous cost if we take 10% of every transaction.\\n\\n**Paypal:**  \\nPaypal has the same transaction fees as Stripe but does not have this 2$ a month fee per active user which makes it a lot cheaper.

It will make you easy to get early adopters  and if your product is really nice it will help you land new users becasue of the word of mouth publicity.  eg:- If you are making something related to photography, you should be active in a photography community\\n2. Investor will never invest in a business, they invest in startup. If you are making revenues like a business then it is good for you but not for the investor. Investors need startup like growth. eg:- You have to acquire half a million users within 2 or 3 months of launch\\n3. Feedback is tough to obtain. The feedback from your friends are fine but real feedback comes from the people you don't know. Here, communication is the key and it takes a hell lot of time to perfect the message you want to communicate with your target segment\\n4. People take your startup at its face value - You will get one chance to impress people. Give it your best shot. B2C customers are not that accomodative, if they understand or your product or it is not visually impressive they will ignore. They don't care whether or not you improve later. Whatever you are giving no matter how small is it, it should work perfectly.\\n5. Your product should be able to satisfy their ego or help them save money.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\--EDIT --\\n\\n6. If you are a B2C startup you product should have the ability to plug into things common people naturally love eg:- Celebrities, News,Food ,etc. People will only take attention of your product if  you are able to place it within the context of things they really care about. They also need constant reminding that our product exist.  I don't think twitter will be popular if they fail to plug into the news media.\\n\\n7.  Finding a pain point and creating a pain killer will just work fine in B2B segment. In B2C almost everything start as a vitamin and gradually become a  pain killer or an addictive substance.

My thinking is that each concept has been tested separately. The finance subreddits already show that people will discus personal finance and offer and solicit advice. The various modelling tools available online or used by financial planners also somewhat validate the usefulness of the product. I feel like what I'm testing is the specific combination of two of those together. Will people be willing to have personal finance traits like income, expenses, portfolio, attached to a user name and shared online? There's a small community on a site called networthshare that functions as a public finance diary. My hope is that with added functionality and a better organised discussion format I can grow it. **As such,** I feel like my MVP should be the entire thing of the **modelling tool, the sharing and commenting, and user profiles with the finance diary.**\\n\\nI've done little tests before, like posting detailed simulations results based on a users' comment on reddit.

It's a big punt as I do wonder how open people are willing to be about their personal finances. They are hidden behind a username, but my hope is that people will be willing to build up these profiles and maintain them. People on financialindependence use flairs that denote age, net worth, withdrawal rate, and income as account flair.\\n\\n**Am I being stubborn? Am I testing the right thing?

I guess I'm second guessing myself because I'm flying in the face of conventional MVP wisdom.**\\n\\n**Edit: I more concise way to phrase my problem. I feel like the separate halves of the MVP exist.

What's a good number of posts per week to make my account grow rapidly?\\n   1. Is posting daily necessary or can I get away with 3 or 1 posts per week?\\n3. Are there any tools that help with the hashtags towards the start when I want to attract attention?\\n   1. Looking for something maybe like an SEO tool but for insta.\\n4. Would it be fine if my quotes are posted on IG with just plain backgrounds but the merchandise are designed with the quotes and a related background? Or is it good practice to show the themed background in the post as well?\\n   1. I feel like having them in plain background for posts is fine because it allows a wide range of designs for merchandise and not just the one that's in the post, but at the same time, plain background posts can sometimes be boring.\\n5. How large of a page do I need before I start reaching out to big name influencers and asking them for shoutouts in exchange for some pay of course?\\n   1.

       "  \"Hi everyone. I'm an early stage founder of a tech startup in Dubai, UAE. I am really trying to adapt my mindset to be able to deal with the rollercoaster of highs and lows of startup life. From what I've seen, most successful founders are able to go day to day without their emotions getting the best of them, but I find it difficult to not get super excited over a new download or a great call with an investor, similarly getting concerned or stressed by discovering a bug or potential hurdle. I feel like I'd have a heart attack from excitement if I got funding or hit a revenue milestone. I'm extremely passionate about my business so that's where the excitement comes from, however I want to transfer this energy into a more calm and level headed persona as it seems to exude more confidence and looks less amateur.\\n\\nFinally to the question: How have you founders managed to do this? What emotions did you feel during the likes of raising rounds, achieving big milestones or exits? Were you always excitable or did you grow out of this state as the startup matured? What was the greatest moment in your startup journey? Any examples would be great!\",\n",

We both decided that we need these agreements in writing, but we're not sure what documents we need.\\n\\n1) What do we need him to sign?  I think we need him to sign an Intellectual Property Assignment agreement passing the code from him to myself.  I think we perhaps need a formal Letter of Resignation from him.  But what else?

       "  'My startup (first real one) is at a point where we are just getting started with advertising and looking for traffic. I’ve done advertising on FB and Google AdWords for other companies before, but I see this as a very different approach, possibly because I’m part of the product development, or due to the nature of a startup. I believe it’s the latter. \\n\\nWe have spoken to many professionals in the area we aim to serve and all are ecstatic, and we even have 2 large companies wanting to contract us out to rebuild our service to their specific needs. Only problem is that they want us to be exclusive to them, which we refuse to work with. My co-founder and I are able to financially support ourselves and bootstrap indefinitely with freelancing work.\\n\\nIn traditional FB ad funnels, we run a reach campaign with a video or graphic, testing it on 3 audiences. Using the lowest CPM audience, we run 3 ads to with no text, the same headlines, but different graphics/videos. We’d continue to test the big 4 variables (audience, copy, title, and media) in a similar fashion.\\n\\nI’m tempted to do that with the startup’s home landing page, but I feel like we’d be missing our mark as a startup. I believe we have chosen a problem that has an audience viable to allow us to grow if we introduce our solution in the right way, but thats my problem.\\n\\nI see many ways we can angle our solution (without changing the service/product) to our audience, and I want to test 2-4 of them against each other. I want to run a single ad trying to get people to visit our link, split testing multiple landing pages, each one focused on a different aspect of our business.\\n\\nI’d give each adset in the campaign the same audience and budget. I’d measure ‘traction’ by comparing which page receives the most ‘email signups’.\\n\\nI believe this is the quickest and most effective way for us to prove traction, and find what makes our audience tick. The FB ad funnel I previously mentioned can come after we prove one landing page more effective than the others. \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts? How have you found to be effective in proving initial traction when you know you’ve found a problem that is begging for a solution? Do you take the slow and steady approach, or aggressively test ideas to later ‘long haul’?',\n",

       "  \"**Opportunity: Digital Learning / Online Learning**\\n\\n**Market Background**\\n\\nEstimated Market Revenue: $375 Billion by 2026\\n\\nMarket Growth: 14% CAGR Growth to 2025\\n\\nKey Players:\\n\\nTeachable, Thinkific, Learnworlds, Kajabi, Podia\\n\\nAnd many more.\\n\\n**Opportunity**\\n\\nTake .0001% of the online learning platform through the development skills that you already have. Online learning will continue to grow at a rate unlike ever before, take a slice out of the cake, and teach development skills!  The biggest growth in online teaching/learning is technology and science.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nThe online learning market is going to grow at a rate unlike any time before.  The anticipated growth is currently at 14% CAGR (compound average growth rate).  So think of compound investments, which is the growth model that experts predicting because the growth will continue to compound each and every year until 2026. \\n\\nThis growth was clearly spiked by the pandemic around the world, but many experts think that it is here to stay.  After all, people have now adapted to learning online, and studies have shown that a lot are liking it more than in person.\\n\\nLuckily for us developers, we are in the best spot to take a slice of this enormous pie.  Experts say these will be the fastest-growing online learning areas:\\n\\n\\\\-          Mobile App Development\\n\\n\\\\-          Social Media and Growth Hacking\\n\\n\\\\-          AR and VR Application Learning/Development\\n\\n\\\\-          AI Development/Machine Learning\\n\\n\\\\-          Software Engineering\\n\\nAs developers, it can be easy to take even a super small slice of the piece and make thousands of dollars.  How can you do this? Well, let’s take a deep dive into how.\\n\\n**Market Background**\\n\\nOnline learning has been growing at a consistent rate for over the past 5 years specifically.  Over the next 5 years, it will grow at a rate double than the past couple of years.  Why?  Well, the COVID pandemic is definitely helping the curve and spike of online learning, but we will get back to normal at some point (hopefully).  So why the continued spike in online learning?\\n\\nPeople are starting to realize that college may not be needed much longer, or at least it needs to change.  Colleges are getting more and more expensive and companies are no longer requiring degrees, especially for developers.  So what does that mean? More self-taught and courses will be in demand for people wanting to learn, and here comes you.\\n\\nWith college prices increasing, and courses teaching you how to code for anywhere from $500-$10,000, then it’s almost a no brainer to go the online teaching route if you are a new developer.\\n\\nThe big trends leading online course learning around\\n\\nCost\\n\\nFlexibility\\n\\nAccessibility\\n\\nEase of use\\n\\n**Dev Opportunity**\\n\\nThis is a great opportunity for a niche market. \\n\\nBy specializing your positioning to a particular type of service, you would be able to hyper-focus on a specific group of people, find them easily online, and incorporate niche review sites that only their niche will care about.\\n\\nThe more niche you go, the better you will actually do as a solopreneur.  Many new developers or wannabe developers will end up finding something they want to do and learn that specific skill.  So if they have to choose between “Learning Python” and “Learning Python for Web Development” they will choose the web development course over the generic.  This will also help you create that more exclusive audience that really values you and your online course.  And if the course is great, you will get free traffic because typically people will start to refer friends if they like you, the community, and the course.\\n\\nLike I mentioned above, if you have a skill set that is AR/VR, mobile app development, AI or machine learning definitely go with that.  Those will be trending at a very high rate over the next years. If you’re a developer that doesn’t have those skills there are a couple of options you could do:\\n\\n1. Learn about one the topics and document your journey\\n\\nPeople love this when you build in public. They enjoy seeing the struggles and HOW you got around them, what you’re building and how you are learning. This would be an awesome way to build that community – and then once you are done learning, create the course for your audience and you have free sales.\\n\\n2. Teach them of development tools – which you know\\n\\nJust because those are the areas with the most projected growth, doesn’t mean that web development, WPF development, or even C++ development is on a downward trend.  All programming languages are trending up and someone will want to learn it.\\n\\nMy tip for being niche is using the programming language that you will teach + whatever field that you will be programming in.  For example, JavaScript for Web Developers, Python for Data Analysis, Python for Web Development, etc.  You can continue to go more specific, and may even help you cut out a better audience, but I would recommend starting with at least your programming language + your field of teaching.\\n\\n**USP (Unique Selling Point)**\\n\\nYour unique selling point is within the course. \\n\\nTell them how they will be changed after the course.  Will they be able to land a job as a programmer, will they know how to develop a website, have a portfolio to show to employers?  Whatever it is – make sure you outline it so they know what they are getting. \\n\\nA great way to put this out in front of them is to have “By the end of this course you will be able to….”.  That will be your USP to them and how to attract them to buy. \\n\\n**Next Steps**\\n\\nIf you want to pursue this idea the following steps should be taken before starting:\\n\\n1. Create an audience\\n\\nBuilding an audience is a great way to start with easy sales.  If you have an audience that follows you, and trusts you have an authority figure in the development space, then it is easier to sell an online course.  \\n\\nIt becomes very easy to pre-sell your course.  Why would you want to pre-sell a course? To validation.  If you think you have a great idea and ask people to sign up and no one does, well then it wasn’t a great idea after all.  Then you come up with another idea, ask them to give you $10 down, and then it will be another X dollars when you release the course and you get a lot of traction then you know that the course idea is a good one and to move forward.\\n\\n2. Build the course without an audience\\n\\nYes, you can also build a course without an audience, but it will be a little bit harder and you will most likely have to spend money on promotions and Facebook Ads, or both.  That is fine if you have some money you want to spend, and you don’t have to take the time to build an audience which can be tough nowadays.\\n\\nIf you don’t want to build an audience, pre-selling is another great idea.  Here are a couple of quick tips on how you can pre-sell your course without an audience:\\n\\n\\\\- Build an email list, and then ask them if they are interested in a course.\\n\\n\\\\- Post on Reddit that you are going to create a course and if you are interested to DM or email you.\\n\\n\\\\- Post in Facebook groups, if anyone would be interested.\\n\\n\\\\- Run Facebook ads asking for users to be a part of a free beta course.\\n\\nOnce you have validated that you have a good course through pre-sales, start building and send it out to them once completed.  But now what? Ask for referrals from the people who bought it pre-sale and then also you will need to start running promotions and Facebook Ads to get more traction.  \\n\\n3.  Re-use technical audiences for another course\\n\\nIf you created a course for Python Web Development Beginners, create a Python Web Development Course Advanced, and then target the same users who took your beginner course.  Another way to add revue without spending money on promotions and ads.\\n\\nIf you would like (and would pay for) posts like these, **reach out to me at** [**crvanhoof@gmail.com**](mailto:crvanhoof@gmail.com) . *I'm giving away another free post just like this one to the people who email me there!*\",\n",

Having a few years experience - as a freelancer as well as an employee - in the field of UI and UX Design (2 years), and also as a Frontend Developer (HTML/CSS/Javascript/Typescript/Angular/Vue) (4 years), I noticed i'm not the 'employee-type'.

It will not be easy, but that's entrepreneurship. In my opinion, people should enjoy their lives, freedom and family more. They shouldn't spend 3/4 of their live in a dusty, colorless office.

       "  \"Everything starts with the idea. But the idea itself is not enough. There’s a lot of great ideas for the app, but somehow they don’t succeed. There are some essential steps and requirements to create a great app out of the great idea, and the process of discovering those steps and requirements is called business analysis.\\n\\nLet’s check those steps :\\n\\n**I. The idea.** Sometimes we get some ideas out of nowhere, sometimes they come from an analysis of specific problem... Whatever the idea comes from, it needs justification - why is this particular idea good? Does it solve a particular problem? How should it work? Which target group is to be of interest? It’s not necessary to make it long, but at this stage, you should consider a short description of your idea. Make a long story short.\\n\\n**II. Business model**. It’s all about analysing the business side of the app.\\n\\n1. **Demand** \\\\- you need to analyse the potential customer. Who are they? What are their needs? Do you want to target a big amount of customers or niche?  \\nThis section should be dedicated to the analysis of the customer - understanding customers' needs and their scale will allow you to create an application tailored to target group needs. Obvious, but sometimes underestimated.\\n2. **Competition** \\\\- it’s important to know your competition. Becoming familiar with the offer and the operation of the competition will allow you to improve decision-making, e.g. whether there is a gap in the value provided that you could fill and thus stand out.\\n3. **Distribution** \\\\- creating an app, you should also consider channels of distribution tailored to your potential customers, and available for you (depending on eg. Experience, budget, political situation etc)\\n4. **Risk** \\\\- as they say: “no risk, no gain”. Every business opportunity has a specific risk. In the case of the app, it could be strictly connected to the app itself, competition or customers. This is crucial to know your risks, as this knowledge is a basis for planning your decisions and next moves.\\n\\n**III. Product.** A detailed description of the product.\\n\\n1. **The overall vision of the product** \\\\- At this stage, you need to prepare a high-level but very accurate description of the product’s vision.  \\nMore about the vision [here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/10-tips-product-owners-product-vision).\\n2. **User journey** \\\\- how the typical usage of the product by the user would look like? Describing the whole user journey allows you to discover all needed elements and features of the product, and also spot the issue points, that can be fixed before releasing your product to the public.\\n3. **Features** \\\\- After analysing all previous steps, you should be ready to list all features, which your app should have.\\n4. **Product backlog** \\\\- list of the prioritized works (user stories), which are needed to be done for creating and distributing the final product.\\n\\n**IV. Technology**. A high-level description of the technology used in the app. It should contain a technological description of system architecture, backend, frontend, and deployment. The technology stack should match the features, your capabilities, user description and many more - I suggest leaving it to the IT expert - he/she will be able to recommend the appropriate technology to meet the requirements.\\n\\n**V. Delivery**. Here you should decide, how the project should be handled and by whom. Should you utilize any agile framework like SCRUM? Hire a software house/ freelancer? Here also you should consider the budget for the app and schedule of work, ownership of the process and also set communication.\\n\\nThis is just a general overview of how you can use business analysis approach to make a functional and user-friendly app. An experienced business analyst can have a significant impact on application development, as having technical and business knowledge, it is able to reconcile these two aspects and provide a broader picture of the needs and requirements of both customers and the application itself. More and more IT companies provide discovery workshops with the participation of business analysts to help their customers make the right decision regarding app development.\\n\\nThe business analysis uses many tools, but the most known is Lean Canvas, [**here** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ)you can check the real-life example.\\n\\nWhen it comes to standing out from other apps, it all comes down to conclusions drawn from the competition and customer needs analysis. However, it is also varied and depends on many factors, such as market size, customer preferences, competition profile, distribution time, distribution channel etc.\\n\\nThe most obvious way to stand out from the competition is to offer potential customers something that the competition doesn't. But that's not the only way to stand out.\\n\\nYou need to find your own way to attract customers - some advice, how to do that you can find [**here**](https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/7-ways-to-attract-app-users).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOriginal source: [https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-translate-your-ideas-into-a-functioning-user-friendly-app-What-would-differentiate-it-from-other-apps-that-may-be-available](https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-translate-your-ideas-into-a-functioning-user-friendly-app-What-would-differentiate-it-from-other-apps-that-may-be-available)\\n\\nauthor: [Agnieszka Dajewska](https://www.quora.com/profile/Agnieszka-Dajewska)\",\n",

The market is currently dominated by two websites but none of them have enough features or a good enough interface to reach their potential.\\n\\nI have 25+ new features that I think will significantly improve the game experience, along with a lot of improvements to the app interface.\\n\\nAnother important aspect is the news and analysis about fantasy football: while in the US there hundreds, probably thousands of journalists and experts working specifically on fantasy sports full-time, both via social media, websites, TV, radio, podcasts, this industry is almost non-existent in Italy, there are only a few websites that focus on Fantacalcio (fantasy football) news/tips and none of them provide any worthy analysis or statistical research, which is strange for a game played by over 6 million people in Italy. On TV, there is currently only one 30-minute show which airs once a week on Sky (paid channel that also shows most of the league’s games), but even then it’s just feelings-based analysis rather than statistical, weird a game that’s literally based on numbers.\\nMy first and most accessible goal is to open a website that focuses on statistical analysis of the game with actually useful tips, I hope to do this soon, but the main one is to have a company that takes over as the top website in the market for game platform and media related to the game at the same time, through multiple media resources.\\n\\nFor some context here is some data about the industry in Italy and around the world:\\n\\n6 million people in Italy currently play fantasy football, as the industry generates €12m/year, making Italy the second biggest European market behind the UK. According to a study made three years ago, the Italian market is potentially worth ~€50m/year.\\n~90 million people play Fantasy sports in the US, the industry is worth $7b/year and $200m/year alone is the revenue for fantasy-related news.',\n",

Client management/implementation\\n\\nAnother aspect is that documentation about a company or product often becomes outdated very quickly.

Basically, the whole shopping experience is done over an app. You choose your groceries, select a future pickup time, then pay via Apply Pay, Samsung Pay, enter credit card, etc. There is no \"in-store shopping\", you don\\'t enter the store outside of the lobby. You may not even need to enter the store if someone brings the groceries out to your car. \\n\\n\\\\*Who?\\\\* Target market is families/busy parents. You no longer need to bring your two kicking and screaming children through the store, having them yell at you over the shiny cereal on the lower shelf they want or worry about them wandering off, you just pull up and pick up your cart full of groceries within 3-5 minutes. For example, as you lay in bed on a Sunday night, you create your cart on your phone and after making all your selections, your purchase and set your pickup time (free of charge of course) to 3:15 PM. Pick up the kids from school at 3, drive over to the local store by 3:15, get home by 3:20. \\n\\n\\\\*How does this differ from Instacart/in-store pickup?\\\\* There is no fee for the pickup service, that\\'s just how the store operates. You aren\\'t paying a person to shop for you or deliver food to you. It costs the same as shopping for yourself just more efficient. \\n\\n\\\\*The store\\\\* The storefront is just a lobby. Maybe a few chairs set up in case you have to wait a minute in line or allow them to bag a few final items. Someone greets you at the desk and once they confirm your identity, they hand you your already bagged groceries. Cold items have a separate fridge near the front of the store so those time sensitive items aren\\'t sitting out rotting if you\\'re running late. Another benefit to this concept is it eliminates customer theft. It\\'s basically a warehouse where only employees are allowed access to the food items. \\n\\n\\\\*The staff\\\\* Fewer staffers are required than a normal grocery store. There is no longer the same need to stock shelves since it is the only place where products are stored. No need for more than one or two front desk workers which replaces cashiers. Cart assemblers are the vital members as they are basically the \"in-store shoppers\" but they act more efficiently than regular customers since they know product locations and fastest way to assemble a buyer\\'s cart (also the internal software would give an optimized shopping route\". \\n\\n\\\\*Money\\\\* Make money from attractiveness of the easy pickup. Save money on less sq. footage needed for the building with no backroom. Cut costs of products for sake of sales by volume (being able to output more products than competitors).

It's actually working product already, but I'm still missing something. It's about selling the product. Being a B2B, by nature is a bit harder to do a sell.\\n\\nIt all started as an application that could provide you a way to subscribe/follow someone without providing additional personal data (no login, no account, no emails involved). Subscription is done scanning a QR code. Bee Informed is also a mobile app, so you get those updates in the app. Designed to be used for many vendors (whoever is on Bee Informed platform). Such as Twitter is. You choose who to follow. But the catch here is that other side doesn't know anything who followd them. They just have information about audience size (plus some other analytics, but you get the point). \\n\\nAnd it was oriented towards event-based businesses. So, for example if you have some happennings in a town where you would be for a week or two, you can follow what's happening there, without getting spam later because you won't be interested in those offers. Or, if you are attending some trade fairs, you can use it to get updates while it's relevant. Later, you won't use it.\\n\\nBut then we had this situation with corona. And all negotiations stopped, because everything was limited. Not to mention there were no events or happenings. So we switched a bit to the supermarket use case, and in general shopping. Retail sector, shopping malls. Supermarkets never stopped working, and the retail businesses is back in action again. So, use case would be to offer those businesses an oportunity to send their advertisements to the people who wouldnt leave their contact data (for any reason). Have you ever been asked for an email or phone number for a loyalty card or similar? Then you know what I'm talking about.\\n\\nI'm a developer, so it was full steam ahead while we were developing a POC, but now it comes to sale, and I lack those skills, plus I'm very bad at approaching businesses. Meaning i'm just too slow in finding new opportunities. And it's even one level harder when you live in a smaller city. \\n\\nSo, my question for you would be - do you have any ideas how to approach retail business, shops on a higher level?

Hoping to get an idea validated.\\n\\nThe idea is an AI assisted aggregator app for personal fitness trainers (PT) and fitness enthusiasts.  \\nThe main assistance a PT can give you is if you have your form right or not and the diet plan. If the posture/form is not correct it might lead to very slow results (or worst case an injury). If a PT has 50 different clients he would have to analyze everyone's form which could be daunting. To assist the PT he could use an inbuilt posture tracking AI to see which of his clients have bad forms and concentrate more on them making the process more efficient.  \\nAlso there can be a chatbot-based messenger to answer repetitive questions about diet etc and welcome new clients who want to try out a free trial. The chatbot can assist the client initially with the workout and diet. Later the PT can take over.  \\nThis efficiency would allow the PTs to take on more clients and the clients will get faster results because of the accurate advice. There are many PT aggregator platforms but none that are assisted with AI. So this would be the USP.  \\n\\n\\nPlease be brutal.

       "  \"This may sounds dumb, but I think when looking deeper into this idea may show that it has merit.\\n\\n**Product**: Personalized Cut-Resistant Gloves.\\n\\n**Description**: The gloves are designed to look the way you want. Choose from a list of pre-made designs, or pay extra for a personalized glove.\\n\\n**Examples:** Some could be based off things such as Super Mario's glove, the Infinity Gauntlet, or a Storm trooper glove.  Other choices would be common designs like camo, tye-dye, etc. The extra-personal gloves would be designed by the consumer for gifts. (Choose existing design, add personalized words)\\n\\n**Why:** The majority of cut resistant gloves that exist are quite bland, usually resulting in a solid color, like orange. The creation of this product could provide consumers with more personalized gloves, and spice up their work life. As long as the gloves function on the same level, the design would give an edge over other competitors. \\n\\n**Who:** Purchase would primarily be for cooks who are required to use cut resistant gloves for work, or those who do it by choice. Also could be for home use, and the ability for the gloves to be personalized  would be a nice gift for people.\\n\\n**Concerns:** All gloves would be made to food safety standards, and tested to ensure they meet the proper ANSI cut level.\\n\\nObviously there is a lot more to flesh out before starting on this idea, but I would like some input/feedback.

       "  \"I'm a young guy renting a small apartment in the Los Angeles area. As such, I don't have access to a home garage in which to do minor car work (replacing alternators, brakes, water pump, etc.). The town in which I live, and my apartment complex itself, is very strict about not allowing any sort of maintenance on the streets or in the parking garages. Disobeying the town code on this can (and will) get you a stiff fine.  \\n\\n\\nI've found myself thinking lately that it would be great if a company existed that was to wrenching on cars as WeWork is to working in an office. I.e., you pay an hourly (or daily? monthly subscription?) fee to have access to a mechanic bay garage that:  \\n\\n\\n\\\\-Is well lit  \\n\\\\-Has a vehicle lift  \\n\\\\-Has a basic toolkit (sockets, wrenches, rags, etc.)  \\n\\\\-Has a TV and/or stereo system on the walls (can cast YouTube tutorial videos to, or else have on as white noise)  \\n\\n\\nIm flirting with the idea of starting a company to do this.   \\nIf such a thing existed, I suspect people would be willing to pay about $30/hr to use the space.  \\nOne of the overhead costs I'm most concerned with is what the insurance on a business like this would be. Progressive probably won't look to kindly on giving a bunch of assholes access to a floor lift that they can kill themselves with. The other concern is, obviously, rent costs. Here in the SFV I can get a building suitable for this purpose for about $4k/month. Let's figure insurance is $3k/month. Utilities and misc. operating expenses (disposing of old coolant, etc.) another $3k/month. I pay myself $3k/month (no other employees at launch). All in all, I've got a monthly overhead of \\\\~$13k/month.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet's say I'm open 7 days a week, for a total of 90hrs/week.  \\nI've got 5 bays times 90hrs = 450 rentable hours per week, or 1800 rentable hours per month.  \\n\\n\\nWith an overhead of $13k/month, charging $30/hr to rent a bay, I've got to have about 450 rental hours per month to break even.  \\nIn essence, to break even, I'd need to have each space occupied for 25% of the time that I'm open.  \\n\\n\\nI suspect that Saturday/Sunday would be the busiest days for a business like this, so let's assume I have 60% utilization on the 5 bays for 8 days per month (or, 60% utilization for 14hrs/day times 8 days = 112hrs x 5 bays = 560hrs x .60 = 336hrs.  \\n\\n\\nIn other words, assuming 60% utilization on Sat/Sun, I'd get 336 of my required monthly rentable hours on those 8 days alone. That leaves another 22 days per month to get the other 114 hours that I would need to break even.   \\n\\n\\nAdditionally, I think it's logical for a business like this to offer other services, like:  \\n\\\\-Storefront selling super basic items, like you'd find at a car wash - oil, antifreeze, air fresheners, windshield wiper fluid, snacks, drinks.  \\n\\\\-Long term or overnight parking for project cars that guys don't want to/can't keep at home  \\n\\\\-Mobile detailing service  \\n\\\\-Hot bay for car washes/waxes  \\n\\n\\nI think this would be successful in Los Angeles for a number of reasons:  \\n\\\\-Big car culture  \\n\\\\-It's illegal to work on your car in the street/communal parking garage  \\n\\\\-Almost everybody is a renter, so they don't have access to a home garage  \\n\\\\-The garages most homes have are incredibly small and cramped  \\n\\\\-Lots of poor people who would be eager to save some cash changing their brakes themselves  \\n\\\\-Lots of upper middle class people who would be eager to have a good, clean, well lit space to work on a project car  \\n\\\\-Temperate climate, so business loss in the winter would be negligible.\\n\\nAgain, assuming a monthly overhead of $13k/month, I've got yearly operating expenses of $156k.   \\n\\n\\nThere are 2,000,000 people in and around the SFV. Figure about 700K of them are working aged (18-65) men.  \\n\\n\\nIf I could convert .2% of that group (1400 people) to using this service for 5hrs per year, I'd be grossing $210k.  \\nIf I could convert .5% of that group (3500 people) to using this service for 5hrs per year, I'd be grossing $525k.   \\n\\n\\nAgain, this completely discounts rentals to women (which I'd imagine will be close enough to 0 to call it 0), and profits from the storefront, parking, detailing, and car wash side of the business.  \\n\\n\\nAm I totally insane? Or is this doable? I recognize that I'd probably need about $250k-400k to get this started, but is there anything glaring that I am missing?  \\nAssuming I'm not totally wrong about the insurance costs (I believe I'm probably pretty close; the national average for monthly premiums for a fully-covered normal auto garage is about $700; I'm figuring for a place like this mine would be about $3k - big assumption).\",\n",

       "  \"One of the problems that we're focusing on is called waste of scale for B2B SaaS companies.  \\n\\n\\n***It's when you are marketing and building a large e-mail list of 1,500 potential customers but in the end, you've ended up as with 30 paying customers.***\\n\\n**There are various reasons for this:**\\n\\n1. **You are not targeting the right audience/you don't understand who you are targeting effectively:** Your product isn't a need for business, the right business, or even needed by the right businesses at that that time. It's not like your leads are going to signal that they need your product right away. It just doesn't happen so you're in the wild goose chase trying to find the prince in sea of *per* 1,000 frogs.\\n2. **You're not filtering out the wrong businesses top-of-funnel:** There are many potential businesses that would be great fit for your funnel but unfortunately, they just don't see the value in your product. You may have already validated your concept, got a few paying customers already, but the conversion process takes months on end and you have to worry about churn on top of that. Qualifying leads top-of-funnel is the best way to ensure that you have higher conversion down the funnel by manually (or automating) identifying traits that leads display in order to ensure that you are getting the right leads.\\n3. **Targeting a non-essential problem in businesses**: This one has to deal with product-market-fit when it comes to getting right customers. Not all markets are the same. In our case, we went after the CRM market. On the outside, we saw that many businesses use CRM so we've built one with a lead search genius so companies can save time finding clients. If you're curious, you can [check it out here](https://tapdesk.io). What we got wrong was that the CRM market was overly saturated and everyone was comparing us to Salesforce and Hubspot. We built a great CRM but if we missed one feature, we would be losing out on a customer. So, we've focused on what we did first: being a great lead search genius company.\\n\\nSo, going back to the **waste of scale problem mentioned earlier...**\\n\\nOur biggest problem as a B2B SaaS company is that we can save time finding the right leads for our company, we spend more time trying to convert the wrong leads. Prospecting individual leads works great because personalized conversations but at scale, that's not doable. The more scale you have with incorporating leads, the least efficient you are going to be when converting a lead into a sale.\\n\\nSo, we're turning our focus towards lead qualification where you can spend less time trying to convert the wrong leads and more time converting qualified leads and generating revenue for your B2B SaaS.

It became a finalist at a couple national/international high school business competitions and I know it’s something I really want to pursue given the increasing global burn care/wound care market size, and the many stakeholders involved.\\n\\nSo, I filed for a provisional patent as the sole owner of this device, this January on the medical device. My mentor wasn’t interested and was leaving to work at NASA.\\n\\nMy initial prototypes of this device did not come out as how imagined but I filed the provisional patent based on what I expected it would look like. \\n\\nNow, I will be heading to the University of Texas at Austin and I am unsure what my next steps should be. I tried contacting a few professors there to be my mentor/adviser, through email, but they told me they cannot work on an outside filed patent or were not interested. I finally joined the research group of a biomaterials professor and eventually plan on asking him how to improve my device when I get there.\\n\\nMy question is, if I do happen to improve my device at the University Of Texas, will the university try and claim ip or rights on my device if I use their resources to help build my device.\\n\\nAnother option is to try contacting a local angel network, to try and raise the money and find connections through them to locate a lab + researchers to improve the device, but I know most will either not be interested or take a large chunk of the company. University of Texas does have a few entrepreneurship/startup clubs to help launch startups but not sure how much it will help as I basically need to improve my medical device first.

       "  \"Hi guys\\n\\nI'd love to hear your feedback on a product idea 🙏🏼\\n\\nAs Makers, my friends and I  have noticed that in each of the products we have built our user experience has been lacking in anything related to notifications.\\n\\nDue to a lack of development resources and the desire to invest our efforts in developing and upgrading the core product, we usually follow one of these two paths:\\n\\n1, We don't develop a notification system at all. In products that notifications are not a critical part of the product performance, despite all the benefits of user notifications (marketing, conversion, retention, etc.), we give up the notification system for other product features and modules.\\n\\n2, We develop the minimum necessary infrastructure base to create the most basic notifications. Down the road upgrades are needed and the system requires regular maintenance.\\n\\nIn addition, it is very difficult to measure the positive or negative impact of the notifications on users, and to understand whether the notifications are useful and achieve the purpose for which they were created, or are bothering the users and causing them to turn off the notifications altogether or worse to abandon the product.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe recently decided to develop an independent infrastructure for notification system. (For internal use of our products only)\\n\\nOne that we will invest in on-going development efforts and will invest heavily in unique user experience, management and content system, smart scheduling and contextual systems, dashboard for statistics and insights and of course everything in simple sdk implementation with easy access to API and most importantly after initial implementation the system can be managed and maintained directly from a management panel with minimal need of the development team.\\n\\nThe idea behind the project is to allow us to adopt an advanced notifications system in just a few hours, with each new product we develop and thus stop neglecting this very important feature.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, deep into the advanced characterization and the beginning of the system development, we wonder if this might be a system that companies would like to embed in their product?\\n\\nwhat do you think about instant notification system or notification system as a SaaS in general?\\n\\nDid you have the same doubts about developing a notification system for your product?\\n\\nDo you think companies are doing enough to provide users with an effective, relevant & customized notification experience? Or will they be happy to get help doing so?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe would love to hear what you think\\n\\nThanks\",\n",

All food will be packaged with sanitizing wipes/spray, and all agents will be provided with full hazmat uniforms for optimum protection from any exposure.

I haven\\'t found something like this, but if there already exists such a device, I\\'d be happy if you could point me to it. In any case, feel free to take the idea and run with it.\\n\\nSo the basic problem is this: you are at a beach or lake and you want to go swimming, but you have a bag with all your valuables like camera, phone, money, car key or whatever.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of partial solutions to this. If you are there with a friend, one can stay back and watch the stuff and of course you can always ask other people, too, when you are alone. Other tips include things like burying things in the sand or someone even suggested using a diaper as disguise. There are fake/hollow sunscreen or water bottles. You can lock your bag to a chair or tree if available. There are waterproof bags you can take with you. But none of that is very practical.\\n\\nMy solution would be a combination of two or three things. A motion/movement detector like [this bike lock](https://www.amazon.com/Tchipie-Motorcycle-Padlock-Reminder-Motorbike/dp/B07G9XDSRC/) (close the look, movement triggers alarm; btw. movement of the lock itself, not a PIR sensor) in a formfactor closer to [a lock like this](https://www.amazon.com/Lewis-N-Clark-Cable-Lock/dp/B00I5IWCPA/) activated with [a silcon RFID wristband](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0LLSEF/).\\n\\nI have such a disc lock and use it for my mountain bike. In theory it would already work as is on the beach. Close it, put it in your bag and if someone grabs your bag, it will go off. However, it has four flaws for a beach setting in my opinion. First, it\\'s quite heavy. Nothing I would take on a hike or while traveling. Second, it makes a very loud beep when you activate it. Third, it\\'s very quick and immediately very lound to respond and finally, it still has a key you have to take with you while swimming. The thing is, at a beach I don\\'t want to annoy people with a loud beep/alarm just by activating the thing or by trying to deactivate it with the key (which moves the lock and eventually triggers the alarm, if you are not quick enough). \\n\\nSo my ideal device would be a light, travel size cable lock with a movement/motion detector, activated and deactivated via RFID band. A little beep signals activation or maybe even a small blinking LED to show it\\'s working. If the device notices movement, then there should be one or more warning sounds, maybe not even at full loudness at first. But if there continues to be motion, then the full alarm should trigger.\\n\\nThe tech should be no problem. For example they use those RFID bands for the lockers at my local pool and a motion triggered alarm should be easy, too. There are small, even [keychain sized alarms for personal safety](https://www.amazon.com/SLFORCE-Personal-Alarm-Siren-Song/dp/B07BV7BRGT/), but you have to trigger them yourself. It doesn\\'t have to be 100% secure. It doesn\\'t matter if the cable can be easily cut or the lock easily destroyed (however, it probably should be water- and sandproof). It\\'s mainly just a deterrent when someone grabs the bag or tries to open/manipulate it. Thieves don\\'t like attention. Design-wise I could imagine something like a very noticeable red disc with \"alarm\" written on it.\\n\\nI guess there could be other uses for such a device, too. Maybe for handbags. Maybe for securing your stuff at the airport.',\n",

Very curious as to what you guys thing.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe overall goal of the project will be to simply distribute and reward podcasts for creating content that you enjoy.\\nIt will also help users in two ways, one it can cap your spending while giving something to everyone you wish, you are always in control of how much you spend.\\nIt also solves the problem of too many people who have patreons etc which may cause you to exceed how much your able to give based on what you listen to and/or force you to choose.\\nSome podcasts also provide content but do not have a patreon set up, this will help to reward these people as well.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe main method will be as follows:\\n\\n1. Users will nominate what their monthly spend is.\\n\\n2. Expenses deducted.\\n\\n3. The rest is distributed according to what they listen to, in proportion to how long they listen to each podcast.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe way funds are distributed to each podcast:\\n\\n1. Each month we will total the outstanding funds recieved less expenses and publish these on our website\\n\\n2. The list will be public and have the podcast with the amount of funds available to the podcast for them to collect\\n\\n3. For podcasts with greater than $X amount we will attempt to reach out to the podcast so they can collect them, otherwise we will just make the list public and let them see it.\\n\\n4. Once a podcast has verified themselves to us, they can create an account which will automaticly distribute all their funds to them each month\\n\\n5. For podcasts that do not collect anything, we will keep hold of their funds as liquid cash until such time as they do collect them.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf a user has elected to subscribe but does not listen to any podcasts in a given month, their funds will be used for expenses and reduce the amount of all others users expenses, allowing for a greater proportion given to podcasts.\\nIn the case that all expenses are covered, funds will also be spread evenly to other users, increasing the amount given to podcasts.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nProject structure\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThere are two main arms of the project, the apps/listening medium and the website which handles accounts and back end processes, i.e. fund distribution.\\nThe website will also be where outstanding funds lists are published and other information about the app will be kept.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe orginisation will be officially ran as a not-for-profit orginisation - this minimises any conflict of interest between us and the operational goals of the project.\\nThe operational goals of the project are to minimise expenses and maximise support for creators.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nEvery quarter a breakdown of income and expenses will be published publicly on the website, feedback from the community will be sought on how to best address the operational goals of the project.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWorking with podcasters:\\n\\n1. The podcast app will use the standard apple podcast platform\\n\\n2. The app itself will only act as an intermidiary between the user and the podcast service, when users download a podcast it will be downloaded from the podcast owner's servers\\n\\n3. Normal analytics information will be available to the podcast owner like the user was using other podcast apps.\\n\\n4. The app will track how long each user listens to each podcast, purely for the purposes of distributing funds in proportion to how much they listen to each podcast.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nA secondary aim of the project is to reduce podcast owners reliance on ad revenue. \\nThe project will not place any requirement on podcasters to produce ad-free content.\\nHowever, if a podcast does wish to supply an ad-free feed for paying users, we will replace the apple public feed with an ad-free version in the app.\\nThis is purely a choice for the podcast owner.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThoughts on a free version of the service.\\nWhen operating under a free model, the objectives of the project may be hard to meet.\\nThis is because without revenue, funds will not be available to distribute to the podcasts.\\nHowever a free version may also be benificial in allowing users to still listen to their podcasts when unable to afford to pay for the service.\\nIf a free version was provided, it would have to include ads to generate revenue.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn these cases, all ad revenue would be put towards reducing expenses, and if expenses were covered, overflow revenue would go towards the funds distributed from paying users.\\nThe reason for this is that the number of paying users is expected to be much fewer than the amount of free users, and makes managing things like podcasts to distribute funds to more managable.\\nIt also incentivises free users to become paid users because it gives them control over where their funds are distributed.\",\n",

Could they compete, and win, if they genuinely prioritised purpose over profits?**\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nA [small handful of companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-control-everything-we-buy-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) own the vast majority of consumer brands. I submit to the House that a competitor is needed, but one that totally upends the current hegemons' model entirely. I believe that, done well, it could genuinely offer a solution to the struggles of late stage capitalism.\\n\\n**Idea**\\n\\n(In my mind) It would start by targeting 'commodity' products (water, socks, paracetamol, even cremations - to name a few) and simply offer comparable products to what's on the market. The USP would be that customers would be able to buy products knowing that their money was going towards 'making the world better', not towards making a small group of people incredibly rich.\\n\\nThe organisation would be registered as a social enterprise, or even a charity, and would be run in the interest of \\\\*all\\\\* stakeholders (employees, supply chain, environment & community), not in the interest of traditional capital / shareholders.\\n\\n**It's a brand, Not a Product**\\n\\nRather than the strategy followed by companies linked above - which is to hide their ownership behind a 'House of Brands' (allowing them to get away with a lot of shady practises), this company would employ a 'Branded House' strategy, aiming to become something akin to a product kitemark of quality and reliability mixed with positive social value. In short - if you see our brand, you know you'll get a decent quality product, and confidence that your money went to making the world a little better.\\n\\n**Ops & Finance**\\n\\nIt would be run in a very open way with high levels of community engagement on product, strategy and operations - its whole ethos is to offer an alternative to the aggressive corporatisation of today, whatever we learn that to mean over time.\\n\\nAny 'profits' would either be reinvested in the company or into social causes guided by our community of stakeholders. 'Growth' wouldn't be a goal, but an accidental by-product of serving a community driven by the desire to see the market paradigm shift to one that's driven by \\\\*conscious\\\\* capitalism.\\n\\nI can imagine it becoming like the multinationals of the FMCG industry, with hundreds of 'products' in various niches, all centred around a 'lifestyle-brand' focused on 'conscious consumers' with money to spend, who want to know that they're spending it to better the many, not the few.\\n\\nI could go on, but I also don't want to share too much as this is a project I'm actually working on.

There will be three account types, an account for the artists, an account for the groupies, and an account for the venues. The artists account will allow them to live stream to their groupies or anyone who wants to watch. They will also have pages that have a description of the artist, a place for groupies to donate and possibly in the future a place to sell there music digitally. The groupies accounts will allow them to follow their favorite artists and get notifications when artists are streaming and if artist are playing live at venues near them. The venue accounts will allow venues to schedule concerts with popular artists near them and notify the groupies of those concerts.\\n\\nNow I'm more of a front end developer so I have that mostly covered.

Then upon creation of the account they enter the emails and phone numbers of loved ones and those people instantly get emails and texts saying this person has created X account and it now exists for this purpose - in case they ever go missing. \\n\\nStill working out the details of how this would play out but right now something along the lines of - if the person ever is missing, the loved ones can go on the website and enter the persons name and their email/contact. Now the user at time of creating the account sets an hour limit - say 16 or 24 hours that they have to respond to a text/call/the app itself with a secret passcode that they set “zebra” and once they text that if the passcode is correct they will receive a text saying “glad to see you’re safe” or something and even if its incorrect they will receive a similar message but at that point their loved one will now receive access to all these accounts in hopes that in someway it can help find the person. \\n\\nThis is just a rough idea and lots of details are still being worked out, but the overall idea is it would be a yearly subscription, very cheap and mostly gifted from loved ones to other loved ones.

I've created an MVP here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rFCVJGLkPs5JiIXiJWgrv3SQK1GtiGSwo7yXroL3pBY/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\n*Problem:* there are lots of used laptops for sale, but finding the one with the best value is complicated, as different computer components such as ram, cpu, and hard-drive space cannot be easily compared. Sometimes it is cheaper to get a computer with less ram, and then upgrade it yourself for example.\\n\\n*Solution:* an app that would parse used laptop listings and compute the value of a computer after upgrades. This is how it would work:\\n\\n- the user enters in what model and brand of laptop they want, how much ram and storage size they need\\n\\n- the app would search through all listings in all regions and calculate the cost to upgrade the laptop to the user's specifications and add that to the total price of the laptop plus shipping, customs, and duties\\n\\n- the user would be shown the top x number of cheapest laptops\\n\\nEach component would have a value assigned to it (e.g. 8GB of ram costs this much, a hard-drive costs this much), and each of those components would be affiliate links.\\n\\nFor example, I want a Dell Latitude 7490 laptop with 8GB of ram. It would then search the used laptop listings (e.g. eBay) and find one which is the cheapest (or after upgrades) that would satisfy those requirements. The user would be presented with the link to buy the laptop, and the list of components to buy for it.\\n\\n*Audience:* people re-selling under-priced used laptops, or low-income people like students that need a laptop for college/university. Would a subscription fee be a barrier?\\n\\n*How I would make money:* through eBay commissions by automatically sending users offers (if they subscribe to their custom newsletter), or on the website when the user performs a search. Additionally, I can make money from ads.\\n\\n*Potential issues:*\\n\\n- I have made an MVP spreadsheet where it downloads posts from a subreddit and finds the best value laptops by parsing the post. Unfortunately, those laptops sell very quickly which is a good thing, but could be difficult to show the best deals to users if they disappear\\n\\n- some laptops have certain components that cannot be upgraded, can be partially upgraded, or can only be upgraded by removing other components (e.g. if a laptop has two slots for ram, and each one can be 4GB, and the user wants 16GB and only have three 4GB sticks, then they would have to buy 2x8GB sticks instead and discard the other one.) Fortunately, I have the resources for a brand of laptop to check this.\\n\\n- some listings are contradictory (they say the hard-drive is different sizes throughout the listing), so this could cause the value to be calculated incorrectly\\n\\n- some required accessories (such as chargers) may be hard to value and to detect, or if the listing includes additional non-standard accessories\\n\\n- customer retention will be difficult, as customers will buy a laptop and then not have to come back for many years. I could diversify what products are shown (e.g. phones, other products so that they buy more stuff), send them related accessories using an incentive system (e.g. they get part of the commission so they pay less for it plus it is used so it is already discounted), or help them sell their used laptop by suggesting a price for it based on the specs and how fast they want to sell it.\\n\\n*Additional ideas for increasing sales funnel size:*\\n\\nSome users visiting this website are looking to upgrade their laptops. Assuming that there is a reason why they want to upgrade (e.g. theirs is too slow, the battery life is not good), then I'm considering creating a laptop chooser which lets the user enter in what is wrong with their laptop, and it will find one which meets their new expectations while remaining good value by not upgrading the other components if they don't need to be upgraded, and keeping them the same.\\n\\nFor example, if their screen is too dim at full brightness, then upgrading the hard-drive doesn't make sense, assuming that they don't intend to use the extra space.\\n\\nThe results of this search would then have commission links and give the user opportunities to buy those laptops.\\n\\nThere could be a subscription fee for a premium option that would email the user best-value laptops as soon as they are available. It would also calculate in what parts can be re-sold from the listing at a profit, if applicable. So if they upgrade the hard-drive, they could resell the old one and get a profit (including reselling fees and shipping) which would make the machine a higher value. It could also include time to upgrade the parts.\\n\\nAdditionally, the premium service could look at many other websites that sell the laptops new and do a price comparison (as sometimes new are cheaper than used) so that the customer gets a better deal. Or if the user is looking for one in a certain price range, it could advise the user that they will have to wait x days/weeks for someone to post a laptop under that price (for example, if the average selling price is $100 and I want one for $50, then assuming the deviation is small it will take a while for one to be listed at $50.)\\n\\n*Applicability to other products:*\\n\\nThe MVP for this product is very flexible, and can be applied to almost any product, as long as those attributes can be valued and are not subjective. This greatly increases the business cases, but would require learning about those products beforehand.\",\n",

       "  \"Hey y'all,  \\n  \\nSo I'm just after moving country for the first time roughly about ~2months ago now. I must say I didn't go very far in the grand scheme of things, just from Ireland to the UK. I'd lived in Ireland my whole life, so moving to somewhere like London was a pretty big change. Moving is tough though man. Where I work right now is quite far outside of London, which means long commutes and everything that comes with that. In my short time here so far the biggest thing I've struggled with is meeting people/making friends and just finding things I'm interested in going to do. I can't and obviously am not the first person to experience something like this which got me to thinking.  \\n\\nWe have sites/apps nowdays for everything, how come I haven't come across one to making moving/settling into an area easier? Yes, I get that there's Facebook, things like Meetup, apps even like Tinder/Bumble to help you meet people, but why not have everything in the same space? My idea is relatively simple, one platform that does mostly all of it. Let me make a checklist of everything I need to sort out for the country I'm moving to. If I'm Irish, let me search and connect with other Irish folk who have made the move before. If I like boardgames, let me search and find a club near me that plays regularly ect. \\n\\nIt's an idea I've been tossing around in my head for the past 2 weeks or so and I'd love some feedback from people on whether they think it could possibly be of use. Is it too like what's out there already? Can you think of other cool features which might set it apart? I'd really love any feedback I can get, let me know what you think! Cheers!\",\n",
       "  'Imagine you’re walking through a lush, dense forest filled with green trees, wildlife and lakes. You spot an opening amongst the trees. As you approach the opening you find yourself by a large, open field with a dozen (simulated) soldiers on patrol. You take aim, and pick them off one by one. You’re then shot by another (real) person. Of course, you’re not dead or even hurt because it is laser tag. \\n\\nBut imagine the adventure, and endless opportunities you could run into? \\n\\nHere’s my idea.\\n\\nVirtual Reality is becoming more and more refined and perfected, why not add cameras to the front, and emulate your enemies through the Virtual Reality? I’m not sure what sort of technology you’d need for this, but if you were to somehow map a portion of land, say 5kms, then use that terrain mapping as a base for your Virtual enemies to walk on. You’d use some sort of satellite set-up around the area to read all of the shooting data, sending the data back to the users. Doing this, could you not simulate a real-time, real-world combat situation through the Virtual headset? \\n\\n(These satellites would need to be accurate, and there’d need to be quite a few of them. Sure it might be pricey, but I believe lots of people would enjoy it if it were done commercially)\\n\\nSo you have a large piece of land, mapped out, enemies patrolling, and REAL people like YOU patrolling too. Create teams, run into enemies, work together, capture objectives, all simulated through VR in REAL-TIME. \\nSeeing real trees, real mountains, REAL (well not real real) enemies. You could even add enemy vehicles, buildings, airdrops, etc. \\n\\nAt the end of the “run”, you’d just dock the headsets to some kind of charging station for the next lot of people to use. \\n\\nThoughts on this idea?

The original can be viewed here. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-want-help-millions-scares-me-j-michael-mike-shuler-ii\\n\\nI recall thinking about starting my first business when I was 15. I was excited about the prospect of building something all mine. I thought about the money and lifestyle I could have. Here I am years, and many experiences later, and I am realizing something. What motivates me is not money, status or power. What motivates me is helping others. Since that day when I was fifteen years old, I have studied startups, bootstrapping, lean canvas, and on, and on. I have started a couple of companies and researched hundreds of business ideas. I have worked successfully with some cool companies and awesome folks, but I am still looking for that right fit.\\n\\nI recently began an MBA program through UNC Charlotte, go Niners, to continue my learning and figure out what is next. This has been a journey into learning about what makes me tick more than learning the nuts and bolts of business knowledge. What I have come to realize with a crisp clarity is that what I want is to help others achieve success. I have all this knowledge, and selfishly, I have been gaining it to better myself. In keeping that knowledge to myself I am doing a disservice to others. I recently listened to a podcast by Jenn Scalia, How to Sell Without Selling Out, where she talked about the disservice we can do by not sharing. It was an interesting idea and after reflection, it connected a lot of the dots for me.\\n\\nThis is insanely scary for me though. I do not think it should be but reality check: it is. Why would people listen to me? What if I give bad advice, what if people laugh at me or do not take me seriously? What I know with confidence is that people do take me seriously. I know that direct reports and peers trust me. The facts are that 90% plus in blind surveys say they trust me to do the right thing. So why am I questioning myself?\\n\\nSo, today I take that leap. Today, I start sharing my knowledge. This article is that first step as I share with all of you, very candidly, fears that most of you have probably felt as well. I am going to start sharing my knowledge to help others achieve the success they never thought they could. I am going to share my passion for innovation, startups and entrepreneurship.

       "  \"I had this idea popping in my head few weeks ago:The main use case is simple:\\n\\nYou want to print a document now for X reason, you open the app with a map of all the printers available (it could be a simple individual with a home printer, or a professional). Then you choose one , a box pops up with the Price/ service available and a button to upload your document. You tap the button Pay&Print and by the time you get there you collect what you have printed.\\n\\nFor the providers they can create an account and choose which type of service to provide (color, volume, laser/ink) + the price.\\n\\nNow even if it sounds simple, it is a huge project to make for a single developer (i'm a grad student in IT in France). You need to make 2 applications one for the providers, one for the customers, integrate GPS/Map functionality, billing system , payment system , trust/rating features, UI etc etc.\\n\\nAnother issue is the size of transactions, the idea is not to set a minimum number of prints,  so you could have as little as 2$/Euros transactions and I don't know how you could make it viable for me or the provider if the payment gateway will take already a fixed fee on it.\\n\\nSo I just wanna know if you have any idea of the profitability of it. Because even in my case I rarely need to print ( i guess 1 time per month), and if I print i'll do it at the university which is way cheaper. For office workers they already have office printers. Right now I'm not planning doing in it for these reasons, but feel free to give me other insights (idk maybe in India  or in the US there is a huge need )\",\n",
       "  'I am currently a high school teacher and one thing has become extremely obvious to me: the future of education is online. Everyone in the education sphere seems to know it. However, no matter how much I research I can only find a few online resources to use in the classroom (eg simulations to use in science class). This is all well and good but if the future of education is online I want to be apart of creating the softwares that replace the classroom entirely and deliver curriculum entirely on a student paced online format. No more “well if you’re 15 years old you’re at a 9th grade level.” Any educator will tell you that any one student in their class may read at one grade level and do math calculations at another. This cookie cutter system that’s been in place since the beginning of public education is no longer feasible with the technology that we have. I’m not proposing eliminating the classroom entirely, the social aspect of education is extremely important. But let’s face it, kids these days are far more social online than they are in person. My idea is for a software that students can work through and when they reach certain checkpoints they will need to come into a school building to complete some in person educational experiences but these checkpoints will depend upon the pacing of the student and not simply their age. Unfortunately I lack the programming know-how to create a software of this level but I would love to know how feasible it would be. Since the future of education is online it seems crazy not to be one of the first to develop an entirely online curriculum. My idea is that the program would take on the feel of a game that students must understand the core concepts and principles of curriculum in order to progress through. Imagine the power of education that’s actually fun and interactive using technology!',\n",

This would mean instead of paying $2500+ to rent alone, a young person just starting out in the city could find a more comfortable housing situation in which they’d share costs and cut it down to roughly $1700.

The main problem I’ve had is I want to pay someone back using Venmo or Apple Pay only to find out that person doesn’t have Venmo, they only have Cash App or PayPal. My main goal is to make a service that acts as a middle man and transfers a payment from one money service to a completely different one without having to wait to set up a new app and then wait again to transfer the money. It would work like this: I would use Company A’s app to pay my service that takes that money and then my service takes that money and would pay the person I want to pay back using Company B’s app. I think of it sort of as a translator for all the different money apps out there. \\n\\nI think the main issues would be finding a way to automate the payments in each of the many apps, and then just the actual task of transferring money between people to make it as a fast as possible. I think a fast transfer would require a large reserve of funds so my service wouldn’t have to wait for the transfer to go through. \\n\\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated, this is something I’ve just been throwing around so I haven’t thought about if it’s entirely possible or just a dream.',\n",

       "  'Hi guys,\\n\\nHere in western Europe (also seems to be the case in the USA though) it looks like Urban Farming is having a hard time being profitable, especially when one is focusing solely on production. First solution that comes to mind is to diversify the sources of income, like organizing educational events or having a complementary catering business - I can\\'t help but think that this doesn\\'t solve the main problem: **how can we make the production profitable?**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMaking profit 101: *If gain > cost then profit*. That means we need to maximize gain and minimize cost. That being said, let\\'s dive a bit deeper.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat would be the cost of an average UrFa?\\n\\n\\\\- rent for space / location: I don\\'t know outside of EU, but around here the closer to city center the place, the more expensive the rent. The obvious solution would be to settle on the periphery of the city but then it wouldn\\'t really be a \"Urban\" farm anymore (we want it as much \"local\" as possible especially if you want to sell on-site). And transportation for the production would add up. Some startups decided to reclaim unused (and sometime unusual) places such as rooftops and (subterranean) parking lots, but then you are constrained by the place (rooftops in particular are not meant for large/heavy installations, not talking about people going back and forth with tools and vegetables) and can\\'t really grow what you want.\\n\\n\\\\- building/tools/system: depending on whether you start a regular or off-ground farm and what you want to produce, you might have to invest quite a sum for the greenhouses, growing LEDS, sprinklers, pumps, aquaponic system etc. The more you automatize, the larger the investment ...\\n\\n\\\\- human labour: ... on the other hand, with more automation come less human labour. By selling \"on-site\" and on \"harvest it yourself\" mode, we can promote both the local and fresh aspect of the products while cutting down on the workforce. People and human interaction will always be needed  though.\\n\\n\\\\- electricity: amount will depends on which type of farm we run, but automation, aquaponics or exotic/unusual vegetables mean electricity for controlling the conditions (light, temperature, humidity...). Can be produced on-site with solar panel (and other ways) but it means more investment.\\n\\n\\\\- water: this one goes without saying, and it might be substantial if growing things that need a lot a water (cucumber, watermelons ...).\\n\\n\\\\- other material: such as seeds, fertilizer, fish food if aquaponics etc.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen, how could we cover the cost and hope to make a profit?\\n\\n\\\\- sell production: it\\'s a no-brainer, but that\\'s the whole point of the story. One way to maximize this would be to produce high margin vegetables or fruits (I\\'m thinking advocado, bell pepper or asparagus – which are kinda expensive here – instead of lettuce, tomatoes or carrots). If we are doing aquaponics, we\\'d sell fishes too.\\n\\n\\\\- sell by-products: not that I can think of much, maybe compost?\\n\\n\\\\- other activities: as said before, complementary activities to support the main activity of producing food.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy take on this is that we are not thinking holistically enough. It\\'s like a factory where you provide electricity/water/material in and (hopefully) get food and money out. IMO, it would be better to elaborate a system where multiple activities would be complementary to each other – an eco-system of sort.\\n\\nFor instance, instead of using electricity for heating the greenhouses, why not use it for something that produce heat as a by-product; e.g think about computers, sell the computing power or storage and use the heat generated for the greenhouses. Let\\'s make a good use of these externalities !\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay thank you for reading so far. What do you think of this? Do you have any ideas about how to maximize profitability? What do you think of the computer example?',\n",

       "  'I\\'ve got an idea and, beyond coming up with some abstract plans, am now venturing into unknown territory and am not sure how (or if) to proceed.\\n\\nWithout spilling details, I want to create a company that specializes in making a type of eyewear (cheap stuff, think like costume quality, not prescription glasses) and some related products. The market consists of a lot of companies producing the product in one variation. However, there are very few (like 4) companies producing the product in all its possible, and arguably more important, variations. I predict that as time goes on, the \"more important\" variations I spoke of will become more popular. The said companies that are producing these variations of it are selling them at *outrageously high* prices for how simple and cheap-quality their products are. Moreover, I\\'ve been looking into these companies and all but one of them has any substantial social media and online presence. Thus, for all these reasons, I feel like there\\'s a lot of success to be had in this niche market, and I think the market will expand and currently CAN be expanded with the right online publicity.\\n\\nThis really marks the end of my knowledge. I don\\'t know what role patents are going to play in this, if this is clear financial suicide, or really how to move forward from here. My thought is that a 3D model needs to be made and then sent to a manufacturer to get an estimated cost and prototypes. Then, I can begin testing the waters and selling. Again though, have no idea where patents fit into this (I know they\\'re expensive as balls :( ). Can anyone lend me some guidance? I take brutal honesty as well.',\n",

However, where I'm from the police do not inform the owners where their vehicle could be located or even if whether their vehicle has been towed away in the first place. So most owners come back to a vacant space and go through a little panic attack wondering whether their vehicle was stolen or towed away.  \\n\\nI want to create a service where vehicle owners whose vehicles have been towed away receive a message on their phone. The message let's them know of the charges against their vehicle, the location of the impound its at and the officer who oversaw it being towed away. There are a few ways I've thought of providing the service.   \\n1. It could either be a software based solution where vehicle owners sign up and link their mobile number and license no. to a vehicles registration no.  The app would have two versions one for users and one for police officers. The officers sign in with their service number, take a picture of the impounded vehicle and fill in the charges against it.  \\n2. It could be a product based solution, a gps device that placed in/on a vehicle let's owners know of its current location using an app again.\\n\\nThe problems:\\n\\n1. The first solution can only work if the police dept and transport office agree on adopting and using this app.\\n2. The second wouldn't be incredibly accurate. Because commercially usable GPS services rarely are.  Also there will not be a verifiable source as in the first case where the overseeing officer could be questioned if a towed vehicle is missing. In short accountability is missing.\\n\\nRevenue options:\\n\\n1. Small charge from fine imposed on every vehicle is deducted around may be 2-4%. Advertising rights could be given to transport office or police in exchange for adopting app or used to generate further additional revenue. Sharing of database of mobile numbers and current users of registered vehicles with police and other govt agencies for investigative purposes.\\n2.

I can completely turn a normal guy upside down with my photos, from being a \"nobody\" to a guy a women would think \"wait hold up..  who is this guy?!\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nwell.. let me just say,.. I\\'ve done this for 6-7 friends now.. they all went from zero  to one tinder swipes to getting matches constantly. Those images changed their game of getting noticed.  I was so amazed by the difference, that I thought men really could need help in this area. I have other guys asking me to help them as well, So thought this could be an business idea instead of doing it for free. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLets face it. Women do judge based of pictures, that is reality. (just as men do) but women get a ton of approaches.. and if you dont stand out.. you will get swiped out. Facts).  Women already have model-photos everywhere, why shouldn\\'t an ordinary bloke show his best sides, his hobbies, his friends, what he has fun doing etc. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe problem is, men absolutely suck with portraying their best sides with photos. It\\'s either the selfie gym pics or standing by a flashy car or a bland selfie with an iphone. these kind of images have low odds of working. Too cheasy and not enticing in any way for women to want to know such person. Please note these issues don\\'t apply for handsome men. But for the normal guys, better pictures makes a ton of difference. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nso, my idea is basically ;  I want to help men with photos that make them stand out,  so they can get noticed and get more dates on social sites.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI want to portray the men at their very best, catching their smiles and laughs and let people see them with joy.

We have a chat and I find out who you are and what you like. \\n\\nWe meet up and I shoot pics of you in different scenarios. I select the ones I like, edit them and deliver results. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere is an example of the quality of image I\\'d deliver : [https://500px.com/photo/250583959/two-basketball-players-playing-outdoor-in-la-by-cristian-negroni](https://500px.com/photo/250583959/two-basketball-players-playing-outdoor-in-la-by-cristian-negroni) . (this is not my picture, all rights reserved to christian negroni).\\n\\nGreat image of showing a hobby, they man having fun and enjoying himself. This is the kind of images that makes odds of getting swipes and responses increase very much. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nor closeup images like ; [https://500px.com/photo/86762809/portrait-by-ram%C3%B3n-espelt?ctx\\\\_page=2&from=search&ctx\\\\_type=photos&ctx\\\\_q=man+portrait](https://500px.com/photo/86762809/portrait-by-ram%C3%B3n-espelt?ctx_page=2&from=search&ctx_type=photos&ctx_q=man+portrait) .

Later your  comments can be managed in a single dashboard.\\n\\nWhat I propose to build is similar to Disqus, \\\\[EasyForum\\\\] is a  hosting service for forum services. I noticed that there are many  portfolio websites built for small/medium scale business like startup  brands, restaurants, or service providers. Some of them have the need to  set up a forum for their products’ users to discuss issues and help their customers solve problems. But it could cause some effort to build and  maintain a forum in their own websites and own servers, even if we use a forum software to do so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nExpected feature list for the ‘embedding’ \\\\[EasyForum\\\\] service:\\n\\n* the embedded forum can let visitors post and reply, and search\\n* visitors need to be registered as a user in \\\\[EasyForum\\\\] website, it  also allows 3rd party OAuth like Facebook, Google login, etc.\\n* admin can set the policy for content control, or avoid spam\\n* very simple to import into user’s website, as simple as import Google Analytics\\n* good performance on every platform\\n* complete admin control\\n* mobile-friendly, responsive design\\n* easy for users to change styles and suit their websites\\n* //TODO\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n1.

Forums definitely have some advantages when it comes to posting queries and sharing ideas, that’s why we can see self-built forums in nearly every website of big companies. But not sure for small/medium scale business, can \\\\[EasyForum\\\\] help them with their websites?\\n4. Difficulties?

       "  '**Background:**\\n\\nI work in the enterprise space, and its hard to figure out what the vast majority of customers want. \\n\\n**Idea:**\\n\\n1. Do you guys see value in having a online space where users can request for certain features.  Now other users can see those feature requests and up-vote or down-vote them?\\n2.

       "  ' There  are a couple of apps slowly coming onto the market for solving the  \"payday\" loan issue of sub-prime candidates needing quick cash. They all  approach the issue in a similar way by evaluating individual  backgrounds and credit scores and taking the risk in loaning them cash  from an account, then charging interest.\\n\\nMy idea is to have a platform  where you can connect people who need a short term loan with folks  willing to help crowdfund that loan. Users would post their story of why  they need the loan and the total amount they need (similar to GoFundMe)  and would crowd-source the funds with other users who empathize with  their situation.   Each new user would have a limit, probably around $250, that they can  ask for. We can incentivize lending money to other users and paying the  funds back by increasing this total limit, thereby creating social  credit on the platform. For example if a user pays back their original  $250 loan the total amount they can ask for increases to $300. If a user  lends another user $20, the total loan amount they can ask for in the  future would go up to $270.\\n\\nThe transactions could possibly be  done through  Venmo and could charge a %5 transaction fee before lending  total amount to the user. There will most likely be a lot of \"bad  actors\" initially, so every account would require maybe a phone number  upon sign-up. Overtime anyone who hasn\\'t paid back their loan will be  banned, and users will be able to rate other users to have better  transparency on who is using the platform appropriately.\\n\\nOther similar ideas I\\'ve seen trying to approach this issue are LendUp, Kiva, LendingClub, Earnin, GoFundMe etc.',\n",

Roughly, that would give me a pricing model of something like 25 to 50 cents for an average photograph, depending on how big they are, and a couple cents each for less detailed documents that don't require editing or transcribing, and probably about 40 dollars for transferring an average video cassette. For really large things, like big maps or something, or doing captures in extreme detail, it would probably be about 10 to 20 dollars per piece.

Every expert can only have X problems at a time. If there is too much competition it is better to steer away. \\n   * In addition original poster can split the reward money two way between two posters.\\n* You created a post only to find out you have figured it out before an expert, and now you want your money back!\\n   * No worries, we will refund you the money back to the website wallet or bank account. However, this can only be done if an expert has not posted a solution. If they did post a solution then you can only refund 75% of the reward money.\\n* Less fortunate people who want to learn will be hurt the most from a service like this.\\n   * All the questions asked and answers will be free to view for everyone. Unless, the original poster requested the answer to be private. However, original poster has to pay a fee to keep the answer hidden or removed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs someone who is learning how to code, and just barely scratched the surface of coding.

       "  'Hey, \\n\\nI have been thinking about this idea for a while but I finally need to decide whether to pursue the idea or not. The idea is fairly simple: buy furniture (and things like TVs, microwaves, and printer) on sales from stores or in good condition from places like craigslist and Facebook and rent it to college students for affordable prices. The competitors in my area don\\'t offer affordable options, the lowest one I found was for a bed and a nightstand and it was $99 a month. At this price point no college student would spend that much monthly because after a year it just makes more sense to buy the furniture yourself for less than $1,200. I think I can bring down the price a lot by using a security deposit. Students puts down a deposit, pay a small monthly fee maybe somewhere between $20-80 per piece or set, and when the rental period is done the deposit is returned if the rental is returned in a \"reasonable\" condition. My target market would be students living in off campus housing and foreign exchange student.  If this existed during my time in school I would definitely have been willing to pay $200 per semester or $400 for the year to have nice furniture especially if I didn\\'t have to worry about moving it or what to do with it afterwards. I think the deposit really allows the prices to be substantially lower and make it more affordable than the competitors. \\n\\nPlease let me know what you think.  ',\n",

       "  ' \\n\\nHello everyone ! Me and my wife were thinking about an idea to create a system or machine to help anyone make small wishes come true. When I say small wishes, I mean its limited to any type of items from an online store (except harmful items like alcohol, tobacco etc.).\\n\\nHow would this system work ?\\n\\n\\\\- To put this in practice, we would build up a crowdfunding website similar to kickstarter but in our case it would be about what items people want, not what businesses they want to get backed on.\\n\\n\\\\- To be able to use this machine you have to help someone else first, support him/her with a minimum of 1$. (Think of a wishing well, you have to toss a coin then wish for something)\\n\\n\\\\- When you become eligible to post a wish (by supporting someone else first) you will paste a link to the item from the store and then you will describe why do you need that item, how this item would help you, videos, pictures, any means to help you get support (some content will not be acceptable as per system\\'s policy, i.e. sexual, emotional blackmail or threats, vulgarity, etc.)\\n\\n\\\\- You get 1 wish/month, starting from the day you \"made a wish\". If you didn\\'t get enough support from others and did not reach your target (the amount of money you need for that item you wish), all supporters will have their money returned to them and you will have the possibility to wish again on the same item or something else.\\n\\n\\\\- If the item from the store becomes unavailable, the system will notify you and you will have the option to cancel your wish or replace with another item that costs the same or less then your initial target.\\n\\n\\\\- We will make use of a ranking system to help you promote your wish. This means, the higher your rank gets the better your wish posts are visible or among the top of the list. To make it fair for everyone, new wishes will be promoted for a day or two on the top page.\\n\\n\\\\- To improve your rank you have to be active in this community. You will get points for supporting others, refer others (help the system increase it\\'s community), how many times you visit the system / day / week. Post videos or photos that proves you did good deeds in the society (helping a homeless person, cleaning up environments, giving good advice to those in need, etc.) and other ways to go....\\n\\n\\\\- The machine will have it\\'s slice of the pie (i.e some small percentage of the sums achieved for fulfilled wishes). These funds will be used to continuously improve the system, increase the community, give prizes, create success stories, and if these will become substantially big the system will make charitable donations to non-profit organizations.\\n\\nOf course it\\'s not everything we\\'ve thought about, but this is the big picture. The risks about this idea is how people understand it. Some may think it\\'s an online begging platform, charity, some kind of pyramidal referral system, distrusting, or just a scam idea that can\\'t be true.

My friend is a nutrition-science major and a bodybuilder who will help me create the meal plans and decide on which carbs,proteins,fats to include to each meal. The meals won't be cooked by me, but rather be me buying pre-cooked chicken breast, etc in bulk and putting them into each meal box. Think of a blue apron but for uni students who only have access to a microwave and want to eat food that will help them achieve their aesthete.

       "  \"Hey guys,  \\nI am working on a software project and would love to hear your thoughts on it.\\n\\n**Idea**  \\nIt is an app for groups visiting restaurants to split their bills. The idea is to connect to the restaurant sales system where the orders are stored - this way orders can be matched to customers, so that they can access the order on their mobile phone and find out how much they have to pay and what exactly they ordered.\\n\\n**Current solutions**  \\nI am aware and a big fan of other bill-splitting apps such as Splitwise. However, the issue with these is you need to manually put all expenses into the app - with my solution you wouldn't need to do that.\\n\\n**Advantages for the customer**\\n\\n* you see what you ordered - no way to trick you,\\n* easy to find out how much you need to pay (we all had a pleasure to count how much to pay when having a dinner with a bunch of friends)\\n\\n**Advantages for the restaurant**\\n\\n* attracting more clients through transparency and ease of splitting,\\n* offloading waiters,\\n* possible statistical customer analysis\\n\\nNatural consequence is to allow payments through the app - do you think it's a valuable addition?

This is something that has negatively impacted every college student and graduate in the U.S. Many students are resorting to sharing textbooks, buying them used, rentals, digital options, or simply just not buying it all and hoping for the best. But often times the used textbook route isn't an option because a class requires the newest edition, or extra software codes for homework, and even when a textbook is shared or bought used there had to be an original buyer who did purchase it new at full price. Because of this textbook publishers are also [suffering](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185042/us-publishing-revenue-from-textbooks-since-2005/). The industry is projected to experience negative growth of  -2.27% over the next few years and average student spending [decreased](https://www.statista.com/statistics/592346/student-spending-textbooks-usa/) from 2007-2017. Alternatives are starting to [hurt the textbook industry](https://tophat.com/blog/textbook-industry-trends-grim-future/), and many schools and classes are resorting to cheaper options or cheaper/free school published resources. Overall, the textbook industry is an outdated and overpriced market.  What my team for my marketing entrepreneurship class has come up with is a service that provides students with all the reading materials they will need for a term, from one singular location. That's [CLIO](https://cliotextbooks.weebly.com/). CLIO will be a service that is available to use online or from an app, with the option to save the materials on a device for offline use. It will function basically as a digital textbook rental service. But it will be a bundle that includes each individual students material for the classes they are specifically taking. Implementation includes possibly making this a requirement in schools that participate (to access a students class info), but making it a cheaper route than buying each textbook new. Our bargaining power with the textbook publishers will be research to support students are buying less new textbooks, and profits have decreased and are projected to decrease more. Students and teachers alike are unsatisfied. And Colleges have the [resources to completely avoid the big publishers](https://www.leadwinds.com/the-comprehensive-guide-to-college-textbook-trends/) in my opinion. Having the material be written by independent scholars or in house professors. Any feedback is welcome and check out our website!

Also, the current communication method most elementary schools use is through wechat groups, however, it lacks the need of privacy of individual students. Teachers are more likely to make decisions only on a macro perspective. Some parents may also feel reluctant to speak publicly in the group. The goal for yoyo is to facilitate students flourishing.

Here is my problem, and the solution I thought of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Problem**\\n\\nI\\'m working with a friend of mine to build an accounting app. We used slack for general discussions, Email for weekly updates, Loomio for team decisions, Trello for keeping track of who is doing what, I used used workflowy to organise my own todos, zoom for meetings, google calendar to schedule the meetings, I think there are a few more but you get where I am going.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nKeeping track of all of the different notifications got a bit ridiculous and things started slipping through the cracks so we eventually switched to Basecamp. Which is fantastic. But it\\'s overkill for such a small team (2 of us were core team and another 2 people that help out now and then). Only four of their modules were active at the peak of it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy problem is that if I want to get anything done with someone online I have to employ a small army of apps to keep track of things.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Solution**\\n\\nCreate a one page solution that has the fewest number of features needed for a group of people to implement an idea together.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter much ado we settled on the following 4 components:\\n\\n1. A real time discussion module\\n2. An asynchronous decision module\\n3. A Tasks module\\n4. A module for Static documents\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe key thing is that they all exist on one page. One page to chat, make decisions,  get stuff done and upload the results. Everyone on the team can see what is going on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI left a rationale for settling on these four components below. I\\'d love to know what you think. Can we remove one of them? Should there be more?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Please upvote if you think this sounds useful or leave a comment if there are things you would change. We will the use the feedback to get a sense of whether or not its worth building.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRationale for each component:\\n\\n1. **A real time discussion module**. I hate slack. I hate the constant interruptions. I hate that important stuff gets lost in the noise. But I acknowledge that chats are important. If you have a quick question about something or if you\\'re all online at the same time, you don\\'t need to start an email chain. In my opinion chat is good as long as it now where the important stuff happens. To hammer this point home we only store the last 100 messages in our chat module. That way there\\'s never too much to catch up on, but always enough to understand the context of what\\'s being discussed. If something important happens in chat you move it to an asynchronous discussion.\\n2. **An asynchronous decision module**. This is a lot like chat but it\\'s not a streaming feed of general thought, discussions are focused around specific topics. If someone raises a good point in chat, you can turn it into a decision. Decisions live in a separate module, everyone can see what the current important group decisions are. You can read through the discussion on a decision and contribute to it in your own time. The only rule is that a decision must have options that people can vote on and the decision must be concluded by a certain date. So, \"should we do x\" could be a decision where \"Yes/No\" are the options, and the deadline is a week from today. The wording of a decision can evolve as the discussion around it unfolds and people can add options (Yes/No/ Yes, but only if Y). People can change their votes as many times as they want before the deadline, and they can extend the deadline, but once a decision is made it must be converted into at least one task.\\n3. **Tasks**. This module is just lists of tasks. You can assign tasks to people,  set deadlines and mark them complete. Shows everyone who is working on what and what needs to be done.\\n4. **Static documents.** The header of this one page page would be a 500 word summary of what the project is about to help orientate new people. A collection of important project links, and a space where you can upload important documents. These documents are the things your team is producing. So if your team was setup to create a policy document, this is where drafts of the document go.  If you are making a website, then you link to it in the important links. Basically, the fruits of all your labour.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe two main module that we discarded were **Video Calls** and a **Calendar**.\\n\\nWe decided not to go with either because the effort-to-reward ratio wasn\\'t high enough. Video calls are important but they also waste a lot of time if you don\\'t have a clear agenda set. They are also expensive, a 3 person 1-hour meeting costs the project 3 hours. They are also tricky to set up if everyone is in different timezones. If a video call once a week is important to your team then just add a zoom link to the important links section.\\n\\nCalendars are notoriously hard to build and we\\'re not sure how important they are. We do have deadlines in the app for tasks and decisions. Maybe it would just be wiser to create an \\'add to your calendar\\' link to things if you want to keep track of them on your own calendar. I acknowledge they are important but ultimately we decided that they weren\\'t important enough. I\\'d love to hear the counter argument though.\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

One of the most pressing issue facing vehicle owners is the regular scratching of their cars especially in parking lots, squeezed spaces, traffic, and even at home by young children. In most cases, vehicle owners may lack the time to give attention to such tiny scratches and in the long-term, the vehicle appears older than it should. Besides, visiting a garage is time-consuming and at the same time costly since most garages charge hefty fees for the removal of the tiny scratches.\\n\\nThe Solution: Taking the service needed by the vehicle owners close to them would make them feel satisfied as they get to supervise the entire process at their own convenience and without consuming the time to visit the garages. In this case, we propose a mobile car buffing and waxing business that will be majorly supported by a mobile app. We consider this solution the “Uber” of car waxing and buffing where we recruit localized experts on a subscription and commission basis. This means that by turning their apps on, customers will be matched to the nearest available expert. On the other hand, customers will have an opportunity to rate the service of the experts and also a chance to be assigned to a preferred expert.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

My idea is a Gu pack that contains electrolyte-fortified wine (possibly with a traditional (very low proof) alcoholic version and a non-alcoholic for non-drinkers) and a small basic wafer (possibly a traditional option and a gluten-free option). This could or could not be a replacement for an energy goo, but at the minimum would need to not upset stomachs on a long run.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt would be the same size as a typical Gu (thus fitting into pre-existing gear). The bread would be in a three-sided piece attached to the back, so it can peel off without producing a second piece of trash. Behind the bread/cracker/wafer/whatever, there would be a  variable meditation and Bible verse appropriate to both finding God in nature and taking communion (avoiding the need for a phone). Since the wafer would be glued on separately, the outside of that bit of packaging could be numbered so the buyer can ensure they get different messages. There'd also be a reminder that you are joining in with every person who used one of those packs that week, making it a bit less lonely. It'd be written from a very general, pan-Christian viewpoint, avoiding major political stances so as to appeal to a wider group (albeit one that is liberal enough to consider taking communion on the side of a trail and a weird blend of hippie and religious enough to want to mark a moment as 'sacred' with this.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCommunion is a personal time to take account of how one is linked to their understanding of God, but is also importantly a communal time that must be spent with the community.

But as a professor you could sell your articles or even collections, but it could be done so that only other professors students would pay for publications that a professor wrote and a professor would not be able to collect money from their own students.  This could encourage collaboration between professors.

Please try to KILL this idea, as well as support it, preferably in a constructive way.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'d like to develop a SaaS service to allow companies to onboard their customers on their websites. It works like this: when a new customers signs up, then our service helps the customer navigate through the company\\'s website/dashboard in a scripted way we called \"**walkthrough**\" in a live environment. Each walkthrough consists of a series of steps, each one of which displays a popover targeting some element on the page. A popover can display text, links, video, etc., to help the user understand better. In addition to on-page, this works cross-page as well as cross-site.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere are more use cases than customer onboarding. Use it for employee training, sales demo, customer support, etc. I\\'d even picture this to be an alternative to text-based knowledgebase: one can create a library of walkthroughs to cover common use scenarios, whenever a user has any question, he would search the library for the walkthrough to guide him out. Compared to a text-based knowledgebase, such an visual/interactive solution has its own value.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA company using such a service reaps several benefits: better UX experience than documents and reduced customer support/training costs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*The above is obviously NOT a new idea.* Products based off of it exist for a long time. However, **I\\'d like to add a few things to try to make it stand out:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1** it requires **ZERO coding** to create a walkthrough. Anyone who can browse the web can do it. Many existing products on the market require the maintainer to have some coding skills.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2** **minimum manual update**. When the company website updates, it only requires the maintainer to fix what\\'s absolutely necessary, instead of update all existing walkthroughs. For instance, if the company has 70 walkthroughs, and the company website updates weekly, our product will ask the maintainer to update only 5 walkthroughs, instead of 70.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere is how it works: our system would crawl the company website periodically. When it finds any website change, it checks all the existing walkthroughs. For each walkthrough, if our service finds it\\'s \"compatible\" with the latest website change, which means the walkthrough as is works on the updated website without any glitches, or our service is able to resolve on its own all the incompatibility issues arising from the website change for the walkthrough, it\\'s done with it. Otherwise, it marks the walkthrough as \"dirty\", thus in need for an manual update.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**3** **control flow**. Our product allows one to specify certain conditions based on which steps might be skipped, branched, terminated, etc. This opens up possibilities for implementing personalized walkthroughs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPricing wise, I am thinking of a basic plan under 100 USD/month, then go from there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat\\'s basically it. Again, try to prove the above ideas wrong, criticize with constructive comments. Upvote if you would buy such a service for your company.

This is where an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) can come in. An ARG blends the narrative of a online based game with the real world.

       "  \"**Angel Match** is a database of 50k+ Angels and VCs to help you raise capital for your startup.\\xa0([https://www.angelmatch.io](https://www.angelmatch.io/))\\n\\nSearching for investors who are the right fit for your business is an exhausting and challenging process. Manually gathering data by going through every investor's profile on LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Twitter, Personal Websites, AngelList, and email-finding tools is the last thing every founder has time for.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ve compiled 50k+ angels and venture capitalists in one place, categorizing them by their names, locations, investments interests, past investments, and companies they are associated with. Angel Match provides investor contact tags such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and AngelList along with the links of companies they are associated with. Currently out of 50k+ investors, 43k+ of them have emails.\\xa0\\n\\n💵 **Personal experience of raising capital:** About a year ago, I went through the process of raising capital myself for our Fintech startup called Richie ([https://richieinvest.com](https://richieinvest.com/)) and unfortunately we had no one in our personal network who could refer us to investors. So we tried cold-emailing and as a result we managed to set up phone calls with some of the most elite venture partners from FF Ventures, Light Speed Venture Partners, Cherubic Ventures, and the co-founder of a multibillion dollar startup [Wish.com](http://wish.com/).\\xa0\\n\\n😰**Problems we faced searching for the right investors:** Since we weren’t able to find any decent tools that could help us find investors, we’ve searched and built our investor list ourselves using an excel spreadsheet. Jokes aside, it was not fun at all. In 3 weeks of hard work, we gathered the data of \\\\~600 investors with their names, location and emails. That’s when we understood that there must be so many founders who face the same challenge as we did looking for investors.\\xa0\\n\\n⚡️**Investor database' product we’ve built previously:** In June 2018, along with other 3 people, I co-founded **Investor Hunt**: a database of 40k investors to raise your seed round (turned into 3-4k MRR business). I worked on the marketing side of the product and I spoke with over 1000 founders and C-level executives of startups in various sectors. By listening to their concerns, feedback, and problems, I found that there were some **major flaws**\\xa0that Investor Hunt had.\\n\\nI’ve decided to build Angel Match from the ground up with my tech partner, creating a more sophisticated data searching tool and a reworked and improved algorithm. As a result, we have much richer datasets, more investors, more sources to verify the accuracy of information of investors, and better data updating tools. We’ve worked on Angel Match since October 2018 and today we are excited to launch the largest and the most comprehensive investor database that exists on internet.\\xa0\\n\\n☝️Note: Angel Match has no association with Investor Hunt, it was independently built and developed from scratch. If you have any questions or feedback, I would love to hear them. Thanks for reading\\xa0🙏\\n\\n\\\\-Rashid Khasanov\",\n",

You work so hard to be one of the bests in Facebook, but after a few years it starts to lose the battle of publicity to other ones and all your past efforts reside unseen in the pages of history. This is the very sad truth of social networks and its only getting worse. One day vine. One day Insta, next day snapchat,.....\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe reason behind their success and collapse is the features, interface, limitations and their priorities toward types of media they let their users share.\\n\\nBut you can't make everyone happy and finally, they will move to a fancier social network with better looks and more features ( or just simpler and more robust ones)\\n\\nThe only way you can make people happy is letting them choose their own worlds, features, media,.... \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\nMy idea is a social network in a 3D Modular open world Game Social media. \\n\\nI got to say for today's culture and technology this is far fetched to become reality, but give it 10 years from now and this could be the biggest Virtual World we live in.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Modular User Profile Space:**\\n\\nEvery person's profile is basically nothing more than a blank 3D space with infinite dimensions (or limited dimensions with paid options to make it bigger)\\n\\nOne can put any media module he wants in this space, monitors to play videos and pictures, speakers to play music and audio, tablets for putting text content ( or they can add floating text everywhere they like), and modules are community driven and new modules will be developed every now and then and added for the systems\\n\\nThey can make their profile space like a House or they can make it as an asteroid floating in space. But the point is all their content could be shared in every way they like. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Group & Social Activities:**\\n\\nInstead of having Pages (Like Facebook Pages), people can make venue profiles. They Can make venues for Live music (Like the marshmello event in Fortnite), They can have seminars and speeches (Like VRChat, Second Life).  \\n\\n\\nAlso, they can have group gatherings in each other's profiles and throw meetings and parties (just like online games and worlds (second life, imvu, VRChat,.... )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThey can add 3d models of themselves in the world (like VRChat) to appear in these gatherings and do live voice chat, and even add their live video feed to their models (Like Daft Punk LED Helmets to show their webcam feed)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**THE FEED:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nobviously, this kind of super customized profile experience makes it hard for browsing through friends and followings feed. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe solution is another completely separate blank or customized 3D space, where you scroll through all other posts (just like a normal Instagram scroll but in 3d), but you can drag out any content and put it in 3D Space where you want to and by doing this, even your feed becomes a unique world of its own\\n\\n And obviously, you can save them to your own profile (Repost, share,....) \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJust imagine this in VR And its already future proof. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\----------------------\\n\\n**Future Proof:**\\n\\nThis Social network is basically a Virtual game world and we all know games last longer than Social networks.

The app will offer a platform where you can share moments with your loved ones.\\n\\n**Problem**\\n\\nThere are lots of relationships that won't work out at the end because of reasons both parties could have avoided at certain points of time while the bond was there. Every relationship evolves differently and as expected there will be good and bad moments. Sometimes we miss on opportunities to catch up on these moments to reflect or to pay attention to. Sometimes just words cannot express how much you really care about your partner.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Solution**\\n\\nAn app that allows couples to have their own private space on the net to share photos, diaries, jot down notes on things both partners like and dislike, view places to visit as a couple, talk to relationship coaches if needed etc. You see where I am going? For photos, sometimes you take lots of photos and even though you share it with your partner by sending via your phone it doesn't give you the personal touch to present those photos with a nice theme and add comments to each photos to make it even more special. If you have issues with your relationship you can connect with others to get advice anonymously if you like. There are lots of options and features i could think of but those are one of them\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do you guys think?

I was thinking of a sort of \"Coop Banking/Loaning\" service, this is mainly for people with small to medium debts. \\n\\nThe idea is to get a group of people together, have all of them pay a certain amount per month and have each member take the whole sum once a month until the cycle is done. For example, 11 people get together and each pay $250, then person 1 takes $2500 for month 1, then person 2 takes $2500 for month 2, until the last person. I was thinking of basically writing an app that would allow people willing to get into it, to meet with each other. Through the app, you can decide on the size of the group and the amount of money you pay. \\n\\nSo why do it?\\n- The main goal is help people get out of the interest cycle, if you have a small debt (credit card or a quick loan), this allows to ease up your debt more easily.  \\n- Even if you have no debt, why not use the extra cash to help people. \\n\\nWhat\\'s in it for me (the creator of the app)?\\n- I really just want to screw with the current system to be honest, I would like to get a percentage to maintain the app and of course money to live.\\n\\nWhat could go wrong?\\n- How can you guarantee that someone will not take the sum in the first month and then stop paying? I am not sure yet, make it so it\\'s legally binding and of course you get permanently black listed\\n- I understand that perhaps the interest system acts as a deterrent and can force people to pay their debt but I am willing to take a risk and believe that it can work.\\n- Might need a way to determine who gets the money when, most likely the fairest way is to have it random, unless members of the group all agree to let \\'X person\\' take the sum.

Yeah you heard it right same book with different ending for different owner. To make our book valuable we will make it hard to buy like the buyer will first have to fill a fork on our website and then he will get a mail of weather whether he is selected to buy the book or not. Our book will have a very luxurious packaging and will have a certificate in it which will ensure it being the only version out of 100.

       "  '(Intro)  Hi Everyone! I have an idea for a Niche  News/Media platform. I am just looking for any feedback for this and more than anything, looking to see if an idea like this actually excites anyone. I work two jobs, but this idea wont leave me alone. I am thinking about going all in and building it. Looking for any help, I guess, hahaha\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Alright, here we go:** \\n\\nI have always been a fan of all things fantasy/sci-fi & genre fiction as a whole. I am a gamer, avid book/manga reader and a binge watcher. In is within these worlds, characters and stories that I am truly alive and truly home…and it is only within the SFF community that I feel as if I have found my tribe. \\n\\nAnd yet, whenever I am interacting with the community (online or offline), I run into the same problem. There is an overwhelming amount of information, and I am drowning in it. And to make matters worse, the information is spread thin across endless apps, platforms and network. I get my reviews from YouTube, playthroughs on Twitch, news from IGN, group discussions on Reddit and Discord. Cosplay photos on Instagram. Purchases on Etsy. Let’s not even get started on the endless comic cons that seem to double faster than Moore’s Law should allow. \\n\\nWhat’s worse is that many of these outlets, which were founded upon and only upon the SFF community are branching out into other interests, industries and passions….all for the sake of the corporate dollar. Further diluting the blood of the community and adding to overwhelming chaos of digital information. \\n\\n**We are a tribe divided.**\\n\\n\\\\-The race of Men at the end of the 3rd Age in Middle Earth \\n\\n\\\\-The squabbling 7 Kingdoms of Westeros before the Conquest\\n\\n\\\\-The Warring Factions before the invasion of the Reapers\\n\\nWe need a new home. An HQ. A Hub. A Base. A Citadel. **Our Vaes Dothrak!**\\n\\nYet, one that is more authentic to the voice of the SFF community\\n\\n***Rogue*****:** *An independent news/media hub dedicated entirely to Genre Fiction & it’s fandoms.*  \\n\\n“I do not wish to be the 5 star hotel out front, I want to be the speakeasy out back.”\\n\\nA. Independent: Unlike corporate entities such as IGN whose content is brought forth by a well oiled machine, stripping the personality, authenticity or honesty from most of their Bloggers and Vloggers, all of our news/media content will be brought from independent content creators, only. Without the fear of competing corporate channels or content, our independent creators can truly flex their artistic ability without fear of demonetization or censorship. \\n\\nB. Genre Fiction: Only GF will fill our Hub, cutting down on the overall content output and streamlining “junk” that can easily fill any community. \\n\\nC. The Center of it All: Rogue will act as a central hub for the community, not to replace all the other outlets out there, but to be THE home and HQ where everything “Begins” or happens “First”.  **(e.g. \\\\*Content Creators give us timed exclusivity to their content before releasing it to their other outlets\\\\*)** \\n\\nPremieres, Breaking News, Reviews, RSVPs, Sales, Products, Live streams, etc**.** You may eventually read, watch or listen to GF content on any of the other outlets, but they will all have a common origin that you can trace it back to: **Rogue**\\n\\nOf course, to experience something special with the rest of the community at it’s beginning is really what this is all about. \\n\\nThus, by streamlining the content, eliminating corporate influence/competition and organizing content and community around a single Hub (if only for a moment) brings a type of stability, order and unification to the tribe. Where we can spend more timing communicating with each and relishing the moment instead of switching between 8 apps just to share and react with all the bonds we’ve made within this community. That’s the Haven I long to create. ',\n",

Implementing an event bounty system where planners can cash out some funds for people who attend it. It could be implemented in terms of virtual points and barcodes that anyone can print out and post on their walls. It would then later be directly paid into the bank or cashed out through gift cards.\\n2. Anonymous gifts at random spots that anyone can give out. Whoever will get there first will get it. Sort of like a treasure hunt.\\n3. Random notes that people can pass around when going through different places. Others can see those notes if they wish to.\\n4. If you are free, you can post a place to hangout on the map and get others to find you through.\\n5. Typing out your interests or keywords and when you are near someone who has the same keywords/interests, maybe you could meet them around? How about a coffee together? Get a notif and a mystery text to search for them.\\n\\nSo yeah, that\\'s it.

       "  \"Evening dear Redditors.\\n\\nI kinda had this idea stuck in the back of my head, and I'm planning to implement it soon (I'm a developer, so an MVP might not cost me much). Polishing is a must, and validation is lacking, and haven't thought about it much. But I thought that this would be a good place to ask for opinions on the main idea.\\n\\nI kinda searched for a similar service but to no avail, so I welcome similar references if there is any. My googling skills might be weak.\\n\\n**Main Idea**\\n\\nA taxi app that help clients request taxi drives, but taxi drivers belong to a certain company and are properly identified and ranked. The taxi drivers can be searched by performance, ratings and miles, and clients can pick between different options available (taxi drivers on turn).\\n\\n**Needs (Pain Points?)**\\n\\n1. Taxi companies are being currently displaced by Uber and other companies focusing on individual occasional taxi drivers.\\n2. Some people would prefer taxi companies, but many taxi companies lack an app or even a simple web page which could help them organize and  show their services, let alone help people trust their services.\\n3. Taxi companies often lack a system to organize, dispatch and monitor their drivers activity; they might not be willing to pay for a custom made service worth hundredths of dollars, and may just need to know where their drivers are, where they have been, the rides they have taken, and their availability (for all that, a smartphone seems enough); all of that from the comfort of a centralized office with a laptop.\\n\\n**Business Model**\\n\\n**Client Acquisition** Besides standard marketing efforts (web/facebook/twitter, paid adds for taxi company potential clients), I'm planning to go directly to taxi companies and offer them the service, to monitor and manage their float of drivers, on a free trial basis; if they like the service, they might pay a monthly amount. After that, implement ride-clients functionalities (rating, ordering, etc) and cover the client payments, offering the taxi line services an added benefit: a new source of clients and free marketing for their lines with their own page and contact info (along with reviews and stuff), and the possibility to receive payments directly via the platform (still under consideration). I'm planning on going local first, and then, going further.\\n\\n**Revenue** I'm still deciding how to incorporate an in-platform wallet for the clients to use (regardless of the country), or just a fixed fee per car per month to taxi companies (and let them handle payment). However, both encompass different approach and the potential customers might not like this. Further research is required.\\n\\nAny thoughts on this? Would you use it? Why not?... C&C are more than welcome. Thanks for reading this far.\",\n",

Most cruises are already designed to be wheel chair accessable, so only minor modifications would need to be made to the state rooms. Then residents would rent rooms (annual leases) and that would be their permanent home. Mid January to Thanksgiving, the ship would sail the world and stop at ports of call. Instead of staying for just 8 hours though, the ship could stay for days at a time, then move along. By Thanksgiving the ship would return to the same port it started at and stay parked through the holidays getting repairs and allowing residents to visit family or vice versa. Through that whole time though, their room is always their own. Renew your lease Jan 1st and off you go again.\\n\\nThe staff and amenities would be nearly identical to regular cruise ships combined with assisted living staff. You'd have one or two on board resident doctors and you'd be required to acknowledge the inherent health risk of something like this by signing a waiver and agreeing to burial at Sea in the event of your death on board. Most cruise ships already have small morgues on board so no modifications need there. The biggest impact would simply be improving the onboard health facilities to treat life threatening emergencies and minor health problems. In the case of most non-urgent health issues, patients could get additional treatment in the country they are docked with or will be docking at next. Severing your lease and flying home would always be an option too.\\n\\nLike regular cruise ships, where the crew is trained to be entertainers, servers, and so much more, this cruise ship would have a staff primarily trained in basic elderly care and hospitality. Keep all the same facilities, piano bars, cigar bars, pools, work out facilities, the spa & salon, etc. Focus a little less on the entertainment factor, but not by much.\\n\\nI'd sign up for this in a heartbeat.

       "  \"Hi!\\n\\nAfter digging up a little on the legality of different kinds of games in India (my country), I found out that games which involve a substantial amount of skill in determining a player's outcome (win/loss) are allowed to be organised freely whereas those which rely on pure luck are not. While sports betting still falls in the regime of games of chance, fantasy betting (which I think of as a layer over normal sports betting) is perfectly legal as research shows that players' skills such as research on sports players' past performances, ability to determine the effect of weather on the play etc. play a part in differentiating the winners from the losers.\\n\\nThinking along the same lines, I was hoping to use the concept to modify old school casino games (like slots, craps, roulette etc which are purely luck based but also the highest revenue sources for a casino) which are otherwise illegal. Say you are playing in a batch of 50 players and before the start of the game the statistics of other 49 players are shared with you in the form of the amount of money they bet in previous games, distribution of their bet amount across various games, their win frequency etc. and then using these statistics you come up with a strategy for distributing your today's bet money which has been normalised to 100 points for convenience and then you allot these points on maybe the different players' performance or on the machines thereby betting on which machine will get the most traffic tonight in terms of total money bet on that machine.\\n\\nI know that this all sounds too vague right now but I haven't been able to come up with a detailed version or the modification I was talking about.\\n\\n1.
